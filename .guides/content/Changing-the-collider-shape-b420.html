# Changing the collider shape

In video game design, we use simple shapes for collision detection
because it's easy for the computer to calculate. This keeps our games
running nice and fast.

The p5.game library gives us two different types of colliders:
`"rectangle"` and `"circle"`. By default, all sprites use a
`"rectangle"` collider.

Compare the two collider shapes below. The ship and asteroid are in the
same position in each image. In the top image, we're using the
`"rectangle"` collider, while in the bottom image we're using a
`"circle"` collider.

As you can see, with the rectangle collider, the sprites overlap, even
when they aren't very close. With the circle collider, the sprites can
get much closer before they overlap.

## Use circle collider for the ship and asteroid

You can set the collider shape using `Sprite.setCollider()`. The best
place to do this is immediately after creating the sprite.

1. In the `setup()` function, just after you create the ship sprite, set
   the collider to `"circle"`:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-header="game.js → setup()" data-line-start="14" data-added-lines="20"}
   function setup() {
       createCanvas(screenWidth, screenHeight);

       ship = createSprite(assets.ship);
       ship.bottom = screenHeight - 20;
       ship.centerX = screenWidth / 2;
       ship.setCollider("circle");
   ```
 2. Do the same for the asteroid in the `createAsteroid()` function:
    ```javascript {.numbered data-header="game.js → createAsteroid()" data-line-start="26" data-added-lines="33"}
    function createAsteroid() {
        let asteroid = createSprite(assets.bigAsteroid);
        asteroid.top = 0;
        asteroid.centerX = random(0, screenWidth);
        asteroid.setSpeed(random(1, 5));
        asteroid.setDirection(random(60, 120));
        asteroid.rotationSpeed = random(-2, 2);
        asteroid.setCollider("circle");
    ```
 3. Save your code and refresh your preview. In your 
    *javascript console*{.voc}, enable debug mode on all sprites:
    ```javascript {.console}
    > allSprites.debug = true;
    ```
    Make sure your ship and asteroid sprites are all using the circle
    collider.
