# "Game Over" screen

If we keep getting hit by asteroids, our lives will go negative. Let's
add a "Game Over" screen that shows when our lives gets to `0`.

This problem can be broken down into small steps:

1. Write a function that draws a "game over" screen
2. Use a *boolean*{.voc} variable called `gameOver` to represent the
   "Game Over" state
3. When the ship gets hit, and it causes the lives to go to 0, switch
   `gameOver` to `true`
4. If `gameOver` is true, draw the game over screen. If it's not true,
   draw the game itself.

## Move the game-drawing code into its own function
To make things easier, let's move all the code in the `draw()` function
inside its own function called `drawGame()`. That way, we can call
`drawGame()` whenever we want to draw the game, and call other functions
when we want to draw different screens.

1. Re-name the `draw()` function to `drawGame()`. The purpose of this
   function will only be to draw the ship, asteroids, lasers, etc:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-line-start="184" data-removed-lines="184" data-added-lines="185" data-header="game.js → draw()"}
   function draw() {
   function drawGame() {
       image(assets.background, 0, 0, screenWidth, screenHeight);

       // update sprites
   ```

2. Re-create the `draw()` function just below that. Inside it, call
   `drawGame()`:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-line-start="192" data-added-lines="197-200" data-header="game.js → draw()"}
       drawSprites();
       drawScoreBoard();
   
       showSpriteCount();
   }
   
   function draw() {
       drawGame();
   }
   ```
3. Save your code, refresh your preview, and test your game. Everything
   should work just as it did before the change.
