# Uploading sound assets to your IDE

Next, you need to upload the audio files to the `assets` folder in your
IDE.

1. In your IDE file list, right-click on the **assets** folder, and
   select "Upload".
2. Find the sound files that you downloaded (they end in `.wav`). Select
   one of the files and click "Open".
3. The file will now upload.
4. Repeat the process to upload your other sound files.
