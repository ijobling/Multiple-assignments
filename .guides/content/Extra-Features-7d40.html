# Extra Features

**Congratulations!!!** You've built an amazing game! But you don't have
to stop there. Here are some ideas for how you can improve the game even
more.

These features will be more challenging, because we won't give you the
code. You'll have to figure it out on your own!

If you get stuck, go back through this guide to jog your memory on the
different concepts.

## Using online references
You can also use the following online references, which tell you all the
things you can do with **p5.js** and **p5.game.js**.

## Feature ideas

| Feature | Challenge level |
| ------- | --------------- |

| Add animated exhaust flames behind the ship |	⭐ |
| Add a start/intro screen that shows the title of the game and instructions on how to play | ⭐⭐ |
| Show lives remaining by drawing small ship icons at the top of the screen | ⭐⭐ |
| Make it so that larger asteroids explode into smaller asteroids. | ⭐⭐ |
| Create asteroids of 3 different sizes (w/ scaled explosion animations), and give the player a higher score for shooting smaller targets. | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Save a list of high scores using local storage | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Add power-ups which give you extra lives or ship upgrades (shields, triple-lasers, etc.) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
