# Making Sprites with p5.game.js

![sprites](.guides/images/sprites.png){.s8 .m6 .float-right}

In computer graphics, a *sprite*{.voc} is a 2D image that is combined
with other sprites into a larger scene.

Sprites can be moved around, animated, controlled by the player, and can
even interact with each other.

You can also detect collisions between sprites, which allows you to do
things like jump off platforms, lose points when an enemy hits you,
or make something explode when a laser hits it.

In order to create sprites with p5, we'll use a new library called
**p5.game.js**. This library extends p5.js with the ability to create
sprites. You can find more info about it [here][1].

There are 3 steps to create a sprite:

1. Load an image or animation asset for the sprite
2. Create the sprite object
3. Draw the sprite
