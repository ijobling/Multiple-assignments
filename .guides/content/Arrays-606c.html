# Arrays

An *array*{.voc} a kind of list. It contains multiple *values*{.voc} in
a specific order. You can store anything in an array -- strings,
numbers, booleans, or any other object.

You can think of an array as a chest of drawers. Each drawer is numbered
and can hold whatever you want.

You can store the entire array in a single variable to reference it
later.


## Try it out!

An *array*{.voc} is just like any other value in Javascript. It can be
assigned to a variable or passed as a parameter to a function.

1. Try making some lists in the *javascript console*{.voc}:
   ```javascript {.console}
   > [1, 2, 3];
   > ["cat", "bat", "mouse", "elephant"];
   > ["hello", 3.1415, true, false, 42];
   ```

2. You can also assign a list to a *variable*{.voc}:
   ```javascript {.console}
   > let gasPlanets = ["jupiter", "saturn", "uranus", "neptune"];
   > console.log(gasPlanets);
   [ "jupiter", "saturn", "uranus", "neptune" ]
   ```
