# Using "update functions" for sprites

Any time you have a sprite, it's a good idea to create an *update
function*{.voc} for that sprite. An update function is any function
called from inside `draw()`. Every frame, the draw function is
called, which in turn calls your update function.

This technique lets us update our sprites on each frame, 60 times per
second.

## Try it out!
Let's test this out by updating the ship's X position by 1 pixel every
frame.

1. Start by defining a new function called `updateShip()`. Put this just
   above the `draw()` function. Inside the function, update the ship's
   position by 1 pixel:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-line-start="20" data-added-lines="20-23" data-header="game.js"}
   function updateShip() {
       ship.centerX += 1;
   }

   function draw() {
   ```
   
2. If we call our function inside the `draw()` function, it will be
   called on every frame. We'll be putting other update functions in
   here as well, so add some space around the function call and add a
   comment:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-line-start="24" data-added-lines="26-29" data-header="game.js â†’ draw()"}
   function draw() {
       background("black");

       // update sprites
       updateShip();

       drawSprites();
   }
   ```
   
3. Save your code and refresh your preview. You should see your ship
   slowly moving to the right.
