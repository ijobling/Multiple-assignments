# If Statements

## Try it out

1. Type the following code in the editor to the left:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-header="practice.js"}
   let temp = Number(prompt("What's the temp?"));
   
   if (temp < 50) {
       alert("Wear something warm");
   }
   ```
   - Line 1 gets the temperature from the user and converts it to
     a number.
   - Lines 3-5 define an if-statement. The code between `{` and `}` will
     only execute if the value of `temp` is less than 50.
2. Click "Open Preview" below to open the preview and run the script.
   
   [Open Preview](.guides/p/#preview=/06-conditions/if-statement.html&consoleSize=75%){.btn .preview data-panel="1"}
   
   *Note: to re-run the script, click the refresh button above the preview.*
3. Input a *low* temperature when prompted.
4. Re-run the script by clicking the refresh button above the preview. 
   This time, enter a high number. Notice that that it doesn't tell us
   what to wear because the condition `temp < 50` is now `false`, 
   so the `alert` code doesn't run.
5. Add another if statement that alerts "Wear something light" if the
   temp is greater than or equal to 50:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-header="practice.js"}
   let temp = Number(prompt("What's the temp?"))

   if (temp < 50) {
       alert("Wear something warm");
   }

   if (temp >= 50) {
     alert("Wear something light");
   }
   ```
6. Test your code again to see if it works for temperatures above and
   below 50.
