# Adding a ship sprite to the game
Now that you've uploaded all your assets, you can add a spaceship to our game.

## Choose your ship!

There are several different ship assets to choose from. Open the
"space-shooter-assets" folder that you downloaded on your computer
to view the images. **Make a note of the filename** of the ship image you
want to use. In the following examples, we'll use
`playerShip1_blue.png`.

:::: div .flex .justify-space-between .flex-wrap
::: div .center-text .pad-small
![ship 1](.guides/images/playerShip1_blue.png)  
`playerShip1_blue.png`
:::
::: div .center-text .pad-small
![ship 2](.guides/images/playerShip2_green.png)  
`playerShip2_green.png`
:::
::: div .center-text .pad-small
![ship 3](.guides/images/playerShip3_red.png)  
`playerShip3_red.png`
:::
::: div .center-text .pad-small
![ship 4](.guides/images/playerShip1_orange.png)  
`playerShip1_orange.png`
:::

*You can find more ship images in the space-shooter-assets folder
you downloaded on your computer*

::: infobox .warning
Most of the images in this project end in `.png`. Your computer might
hide the file extension (the `.png` part), so be sure to include that
in your code.

## Load the ship asset into the game
Our game is going to have a lot of assets such as images and sounds.
We don't want to have to declare a lot of variables to manage all those
assets, so we'll create a single *object*{.voc} called `assets` at the top of
the script. We can then assign all our assets as properties of that
object.

1. In your `game.js` file, add the following line at the top, just
   beneath the `screenWidth` and `screenHeight` variables:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-added-lines="3-4" data-header="game.js"}
   let screenWidth = 600;
   let screenHeight = 800;

   let assets = {};
   ```
2. In the `preload()` function, add the following line to load the
   image asset into the game:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-line-start="6" data-added-lines="7" data-header="game.js → preload()"}
   function preload() {
       assets.ship = loadImage("assets/playerShip1_blue.png");
   }
   ```

   Be sure to use the file name of your ship. For example, if you
   chose the player 3 red ship, use `"assets/playerShip3_red.png"`.

## Create the sprite
3. Declare a new variable called `ship` at the top of your script. We
   won't assign it to anything yet:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-line-start="1" data-added-lines="5-6" data-header="game.js"}
   let screenWidth = 600;
   let screenHeight = 800;

   let assets = {};

   let ship;
   ```
4. In the `setup()` function, use `createSprite()` to create a sprite
   object. The first parameter to the function is the asset to use for
   your sprite:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-line-start="12" data-added-lines="14-15" data-header="game.js → setup()"}
   function setup() {
       createCanvas(screenWidth, screenHeight);

       ship = createSprite(assets.ship); 
   }
   ```
{.continue}

## Draw all sprites
5. Inside the `draw()` function, add a black background, then call
   `drawSprites()` to draw all sprites:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-line-start="16" data-added-lines="17-18" data-header="game.js → draw()"}
   function draw() {
       background("black");
       drawSprites();
   }
   ```
6. Click the "Preview with console" button in the main menu. You should now see part of
   your spaceship at the top-left corner of your screen. Part of it is
   off-screen, but we'll fix that next!
