# The Javascript Console

The *javascript console*{.voc} can be used to to run small bits of
javascript code. It's great for testing things out and finding errors
in our programs.

## Try it out!

1. Click in the javascript console on the left, next to the `>` prompt.
2. Type `20 + 22` in the console, then press [[Enter]]. The
   console will show the result below.
3. Try some more math expressions!
{.steps}

When you press [[Enter]] in the console, it will always
**evaluate**{.voc} whatever statement you typed, and show the result on
the next line.

## Practicing basic syntax
_Syntax_ is how computer statements are structured. If you enter
something incorrectly, you'll get an error.

Try typing each line below as you see it and press enter. Type them in
the order you see below.

| What to type in                 | What you should see |
| ----------------------------    | -------------------- |
| `4 * 2`                         | The console shows `8` and then it says `undefined` |
| `let age = 12;`                 | The console says `undefined` |
| `age + 20;`                     | The console says `32` |
| `alert('Hello there!');`        | A popup shows `Hello there!`, then the console says `undefined` |
| `prompt('What is your name?')`  | A popup appears where you can type an answer, the console then shows what you typed |
| `alert(19 + 75);`               | A popup shows `94`, then the console says `undefined` |
| `console.log('This is a test')` | The console says "This is a test", and then it says `undefined` |

Did you get any errors that say `SyntaxError` or `ReferenceError`? If so
you may have a typo somewhere. Try again and check your spelling,
quotes, and parentheses.
