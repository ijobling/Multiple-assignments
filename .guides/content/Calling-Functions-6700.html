# Calling Functions

Once you've defined a function, you can *call*{.voc} it anywhere in your
code using the function name followed by parentheses.

1. In your javascript console, *call*{.voc} your function by typing the following line and pressing [[Enter]]:
   ```javascript {.console}
   > makeSandwich();
   ```
   You should see your sandwich-making steps printed in the console below.
2. You can also *call*{.voc} your function in the javascript file.  
   Add the following line at the end of your script, just below the function definition:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-line-start="7" data-added-lines="9"}
   }
   
   makeSandwich();
   ```
3. Save your file and refresh the preview  ![](.guides/images/refresh-preview.png) to run it.
4. Check your *Javascript console*{.voc}. You should now see each
   step printed out as soon as the page loads.
