# Keeping the ship on the screen

The ship currently moves off the screen if we press the key for too
long. We can fix that by using if-statements to check if the edge of the
ship is off the screen, and if it is, update the ship's position to be
back on the screen.

## Using `.left` and `.right` positioning properties

Let's use the *javascript console*{.voc} to see exactly what's happening
with the ship's position as it goes off-screen.

1. Open the javascript console if it's not already open.
2. Inspect the position of the ship's left edge by typing `ship.left`:
   ```javascript {.console data-header="Javascript console"}
   > ship.left
   < 250.5
   ```
3. Use your newly added keyboard controls to move the ship to the left,
   until the left wing of the ship is slightly off the screen.
4. Check the `ship.left` position again:
   ```javascript {.console data-header="Javascript console"}
   > ship.left
   < -19.5
   ```

   Notice how the number is **negative**. The left side of the screen
   starts at `0`, so if it goes farther than that, the position will
   become negative.

5. Update the ship's position so that it's left edge is aligned with the
   left edge of the screen.
   ```javascript {.console data-header="Javascript console"}
   > ship.left = 0;
   ```
   We know the left edge of the screen is 0, so by setting the left edge
   to 0, that puts the ship back on the screen.
