# Code Challenge: Pets

The code on the left is broken! It's your job to fix it.

## Requirements
Try your best to fix the program! If working correctly, it should do the following:

- After entering "dog" or "cat", it should say the correct sound for that animal
- If you enter an age of 1 or 0, it should say "Just a pup" or "Just a kitten",
  depending on the animal
- If you enter an age between 2 or 7 (including those numbers), it should say,
  "Your pet is still young"
- If you enter an age of 8, it should say "Your pet is elderly."
