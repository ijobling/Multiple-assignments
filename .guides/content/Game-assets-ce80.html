# Game Assets

An *asset*{.voc} is any file that isn't code, such as images,
animations, sound effects, or music.

Your game will use a variety of image assets for your sprites, such as
the space ship, asteroids, explosion animations, etc.

## Space shooter assets
Normally you would first need to find some assets on a website, *download*{.voc} them to your computer, and then *upload*{.voc} them to your IDE.

Luckily, we've already done that for you!

1. In the file tree on the left, you'll see a folder called **assets**. Click the arrow next to the folder to expand it and see all the files inside. 
2. Try previewing an image by clicking on it.
