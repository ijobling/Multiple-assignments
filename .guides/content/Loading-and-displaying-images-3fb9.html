# Loading and Displaying Images

You can also display images in your drawing. To do this, you'll first
need to make sure you have an image uploaded to your project.

Images are displayed using 3 steps:

1. Declare a variable to store the image data
2. Use `loadImage()` to load the image data into the variable
3. Use `image()` to display the image data on the screen

## Try it out!
1. On the left side of your screen, you'll see we've opened the *file tree*{.voc}. 
2. Click the small triangle next to the `05-drawing` folder to see the files inside it. 
   You should see `drawing.html`, `drawing.js`, and `robot.png`.
3. Click on `robot.png` to preview the image.  
   ![example image](.guides/images/robot.png)
   :::infobox
   We've uploaded the `robot.png` image for you. If you ever want to use your own image in 
   a project, you'll need to upload the file to your project. 
   :::
5. If you have an image uploaded to your project, you can use it in your code. 
   First, we need to *declare*{.voc} a variable at the top of our script. We won't set it to 
   anything just yet, so we just use `let` without the equals sign:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-header="drawing.js" data-added-lines="6" data-line-start="4"}
   let x = 10;
   let y = 10;
   let robotImage;
   ```
6. Next, we need to add a new function called `preload()`. This is
   another "magic" p5 function. It is automatically called *before* the
   `setup()` function: 
   ```javascript {.numbered data-header="drawing.js" data-added-lines="7-10" data-line-start="6"}
   let robotImage;

   function preload() {
       robotImage = loadImage("robot.png");
   }
   ```
   ::: infobox
   `preload()` is another "special" p5 function. Use `preload()`
   to load any assets in your game, such as images or sound
   effects.
   :::
7. Finally, in our `draw()` function we can draw our image. Let's
   replace the red square with our robot!
   ```javascript {.numbered data-header="drawing.js" data-added-lines="22" data-removed-lines="18,21" data-line-start="16"}
   function draw() {
       background("white");
       fill("red");
       x += 5;
       y += 5;
       rect(x, y, 50, 50);
       image(robotImage, x, y);
   }
   ```
8. Refresh your preview, and you should now see the robot flying across
   the screen!
