# Detecting the right side of the screen
Now we need to do the same thing for the right side of the screen. We
know the left edge of the screen is `0`, but how do we know the right
side?

Our screen is currently `600` pixels wide, so if the ship's *right* edge
goes higher than `600`, we know it's off the screen.

At the top of your script, you'll see we've defined variables for
`screenWidth` and `screenHeight`. We'll use these variables instead of
typing the numbers themselves. That way in case we change the size of
our screen, we won't have to update our code everywhere else.

1. Add another if-statement that uses the `screenWidth` variable to
   check if the right side of the ship is off-screen:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-line-start="28" data-added-lines="32-34" data-header="game.js â†’ updateship()" data-caption="If the ship's right edge is greater than the screen width, update the position so that the right edge equals the screen width."}
       // don't allow the ship to go out of bounds
       if (ship.left < 0) {
           ship.left = 0;
       }
       if (ship.right > screenWidth) {
           ship.right = screenWidth;
       }
   }
   ```
2. Save and refresh your preview. Click on game screen, and try to make
   the ship go off the right side of the screen. You should now see that
   the ship won't go off the right side no matter how much you try.

## Up next:
Next we'll add some asteroids to the game that fly past the ship in
random directions. But first, we need to learn about some new javascript
concepts: **arrays** and **loops**.
