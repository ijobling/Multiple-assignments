# Logical Operators

## Practice using logical operators in Javascript

In javascript, we use different symbols for **AND** and **OR**:

|          |                |
| -------- | -------------- |
| AND      | &rarr; `&&`    |
| OR       | &rarr; `\|\|`  |

{.operators-in-js}

Here are some examples of using the `&&` and `||` operators:
```javascript
// rating is > 3 AND the genre is sci-fi
if (rating > 3 && genre === "sci-fi") {
    alert("Sci-fi fans love this movie!");
}

// genre is either comedy OR romantic-comedy
if (genre === "comedy" || genre === "romantic-comedy") {
    alert("This movie will make you laugh!");
}
```

## Try it out: Write a program that recommends activities based on weather
1. In the editor on the left is a file called `weather.js`. 
   Each if-statement in this code a comment above it explaining the
   condition. However, the conditional part of the if statement, the
   part between parentheses `()`, is missing.
2. Add the missing conditional expressions using logical operators such
   as `&&` and `||`. The first one has been done for you!
3. When you're ready to test, click the "Open Preview" button below to run 
   your code and test with different temperatures / weather types to see if 
   each response works as expected.
   
   [Open Preview](.guides/p/#preview=/06-conditions/weather.html&consoleSize=75%){.btn .preview data-panel="1"}
   
   *Note: to re-run the script, click the refresh button above the preview.*
