# Send the asteroid spinning

Sprites also have a property called `.rotationSpeed`, which makes them
constantly rotate in place by a number of degrees every frame.

::: infobox .warning
**Remember**: You will need to switch to your game preview before
running each command to see the effect it has on the sprite.
:::

1. Try using the *javascript console*{.voc} to make the ship rotate:
   ```javascript {.console data-header="Javascript console"}
   > ship.rotationSpeed = 1;
   > ship.rotationSpeed = 2;
   > ship.rotationSpeed = -2;
   ```
   Try experimenting with different numbers!
   ::: infobox
   You can use negative numbers to make the sprite rotate
   counter-clockwise.
   :::
2. Now that we know how `rotationSpeed` works, let's make our asteroid
   more realistic by causing it to rotate. Update your `createAsteroid()`
   function to set its rotation speed to `2`:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-line-start="21" data-added-lines="27" data-header="game.js â†’ createAsteroid()"}
   function createAsteroid() {
       let asteroid = createSprite(assets.bigAsteroid);
       asteroid.top = 0;
       asteroid.centerX = screenWidth / 2;
       asteroid.setSpeed(5);
       asteroid.setDirection(90);
       asteroid.rotationSpeed = 2;
   }
   ```
3. Save your code and refresh your preview. Use the 
   *javascript console*{.voc} to create another asteroid:
   ```javascript  {.console}
   > createAsteroid();
   ```
   You should now see your asteroid slowly spinning as it moves downward.
