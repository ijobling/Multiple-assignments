# Explode the ship when hit by an asteroid

Now you can update your code so that your ship explodes when it collides
with an asteroid.

1. In your `handleShipAsteroidCollision()` function, change the ship's
   animation to `"explosion"`:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-header="game.js â†’ handleShipAsteroidCollision()" data-line-start="45" data-added-lines="47"}
   function handleShipAsteroidCollision(ship, asteroid) {
       asteroid.remove();
       ship.changeAnimation("explosion");
   }
   ```
2. Save your code and refresh your preview. Move your ship so it gets
   hit by an asteroid. Notice how the explosion doesn't stop!

   We need some way to change the ship's animation back to `"normal"` as
   soon as the explosion finishes.

## Switching back to normal when the animation completes
Sprite animations have a property called `onComplete`. You can set this
to reference a custom function. That function will be called when the
animation has finished playing.

We can use this to switch the ship back to normal when the explosion
animation finishes.

1. Create a new function called `shipFinishedExploding()`. Inside that
   function, change the ship's animation back to `"normal"`. You can put
   this function just before the `handleShipAsteroidCollision()`
   function.
   ```javascript {.numbered data-header="game.js" data-line-start="45" data-added-lines="45-48"}
   function shipFinishedExploding() {
       ship.changeAnimation("normal");
   }

   function handleShipAsteroidCollision(ship, asteroid) {
       asteroid.remove();
       ship.changeAnimation("explosion");
   }
   ```
2. Back inside the `handleShipAsteroidCollision()` function, just after
   setting changing the animation to `"explosion"`, set the animation's
   `.onComplete` property to reference the function you just created:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-header="game.js" data-line-start="45" data-added-lines="52"}
   function shipFinishedExploding() {
       ship.changeAnimation("normal");
   }

   function handleShipAsteroidCollision(ship, asteroid) {
       asteroid.remove();
       ship.changeAnimation("explosion");
       ship.animation.onComplete = shipFinishedExploding;
   }
   ```
   ::: infobox
   When we put parentheses after a function name, the function will be
   immediately called. In this case, we want to only _reference_ the
   function, so we don't use parentheses.

3. Save your code and refresh your preview. Move your ship to get hit by
   an asteroid. The explosion animation should play once, and go
   immediately back to normal (try not to get hit by another asteroid in
   the meantime!)
