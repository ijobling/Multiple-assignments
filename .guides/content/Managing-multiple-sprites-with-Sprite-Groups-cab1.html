# Managing multiple sprites with Sprite Groups

If you have more than one of the same sprite in your game, it's always
good idea to create a sprite group. A *sprite group*{.voc} allows you to
more easily manage multiple sprites.

A sprite group is very similar to an *array*{.voc} -- you can add
sprites and remove sprites from the group. You can also use them in a
*for-of*{.voc} loop.

To create a sprite group, use the `createGroup()` function.

## Create a sprite group for asteroids

1. At the top of your script, where you've declared the ship variable,
   declare another variable called `asteroids`:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-line-start="4" data-added-lines="7" data-header="game.js"}
   let assets = {};

   let ship;
   let asteroids;
   ```

   This variable is *declared*{.voc} in the global scope, but will be
   *assigned*{.voc} in the `setup()` function. This allows us to access
   the variable anywhere in our script.
   :::
2. In your `setup()` function, just after creating the ship, use
   `createGroup()` to create the sprite group for the asteroids:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-line-start="14" data-added-lines="20-22" data-header="game.js → setup()"}
   function setup() {
      createCanvas(screenWidth, screenHeight);

      ship = createSprite(assets.ship);
      ship.bottom = screenHeight - 20;
      ship.centerX = screenWidth / 2;

      // create the sprite group for asteroids
      asteroids = createGroup();
   }
   ```
3. Now we want to make it so that every time an asteroid is created, it
   gets added to the sprite group:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-line-start="31" data-added-lines="32-34" data-header="game.js → createAsteroid()"}
       asteroid.rotationSpeed = random(-2, 2);

       // Add the newly created asteroid to the sprite group
       asteroids.add(asteroid);
   }
   ```

The p5.game library automatically creates a group called `allSprites`.
Any time you use `createSprite()`, the sprite is automatically added to
this group.
