# Switching to the "Game Over" screen

Now we just need to switch the `gameOver` variable to `true` when we run
out of lives:

1. In the `shipFinishedExplding()` function, just after we decrement the
   `lives` variable, add an *if-statement*{.voc} that sets `gameOver` to
   `0` if `lives` equals `0`:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-line-start="86" data-added-lines="90-92" data-header="game.js â†’ shipFinishedExplding()"}
   function shipFinishedExploding() {
       ship.changeAnimation("normal");
       ship.isExploding = false;
       lives--;
       if (lives === 0) {
           gameOver = true;
       }
   }
   ```
2. Save your code and refresh your preview. Make your ship get hit by an
   asteroid 3 times. After that, you should see your "Game Over" screen!
