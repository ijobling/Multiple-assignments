# String Expressions

## Try it out: write text expressions using strings

A *string*{.voc} is a type of value that contains letters, numbers, and
symbols.  Strings are enclosed in either `"`double quotes`"` or
`'`single quotes`'`.

Try the following in your *javascript console*{.voc}:

1. Use the `+` operator to combine two strings:
   ```javascript {.console .s12 .m8}
   > "My name is " + "Sofia"
   < "My name is Sofia"
   ```
2. What happens when you add a string to a number?
   ```javascript {.console .s12 .m8}
   > "The number is " + 4
   < "The number is 4"
   ```
3. Try adding multiple numbers to the string.  
   Why do you think the result is different when using parenthesis?
   ```javascript {.console .s12 .m8}
   > "The number is " + 4 + 2
   < "The number is 42"
   > "The number is " + (4 + 2)
   < "The number is 6"
   ```
4. You can also put expressions inside strings. Instead of quotes,
   surround the string in \`*backticks*{.voc}\`. Then you can put expressions
   inside `${` and `}`, like so:
   ```javascript {.console .s12 .m8}
   > `Five pounds equals ${5 * 16} ounces`
   < "Five pounds equals 80 ounces"
{.steps .continue}
