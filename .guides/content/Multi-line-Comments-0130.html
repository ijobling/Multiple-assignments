# Multi-line comments

Sometimes you need longer code comments that don't fit on one line. To
make multi-line comments, start the comment with `/*` and end it with
`*/`, like so:

```javascript
/*
The getArea() function accepts two parameters, width and height.
It returns the total area by multiplying both numbers.
  
Example usage: let size = getArea(10, 20);
*/
function getArea(width, height) {
    return width * height;
}
```

Here's the same thing, but using a different "style". Notice how the
comment still starts with `/*` and ends with `*/`:

```javascript
/**
 * The getArea() function accepts two parameters, width and height.
 * It returns the total area by multiplying both numbers.
 * 
 * Example usage: let size = getArea(10, 20);
 **/
function getArea(width, height) {
    return width * height;
}
```

Whenever you write code, try to re-read what you've written as if you
were another coder. Is it immediately obvious what your code does? In
most cases, it's best to write comments to explain what your code does.
