# Animation using the `draw()` function
![frames example](.guides/images/frames.png){.float-right .s4}

All video games work on the concept of *animation*{.voc}

When you look at a flip-book animation, you're not really seeing
movement. You're seeing one image after another really, really fast.
Each image is called a *frame*{.voc}.

When you look at a computer animation, you're seeing about **60** frames
every second.


## Using the `draw()` function to animate

The `draw()` function is automatically called by p5 every frame. That
means the function runs over and over again, about 60 times every
second!

The `draw()` function should represent drawing **one** frame. You can
animate things by creating *variables*{.voc} that change over time.


## Try it out!
Let's move a square across the screen by increasing its `x` and `y`
coordinates by 5 pixels every second.

1. At the top of your `drawing.js` file, declare two variables named `x`
   and `y` and set them both to `10`:

   ```javascript {.numbered data-header="drawing.js" data-added-lines="3-5"}
   let screenWidth = 600;
   let screenHeight = 800;
   
   let x = 10;
   let y = 10;
   ```
2. Inside the draw() function, create a 50 x 50 red square. Use the `x`
   and `y` variables for the coordinates:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-header="drawing.js" data-added-lines="12-13" data-line-start="11"}
   function draw() {
       fill("red");
       rect(x, y, 50, 50);
   }
   ```
3. Refresh your preview. You should see a red box on the screen.
4. Our red box doesn't move because the `x` and `y` variables aren't
   changing. Let's *increment*{.voc} both variables by 5 in the
   `draw()` function:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-header="drawing.js" data-added-lines="13-14" data-line-start="11"}
   function draw() {
       fill("red");
       x += 5;
       y += 5;
       rect(x, y, 50, 50);
   }
   ```

   **Remember**: Any time you have variables that change every frame, be
   sure to declare them **outside** of the `draw()` function (usually at
   the top of your script). Otherwise, the variables will be re-set
   every frame.

   **Also**, don't declare them inside the `setup()` function. Variables
   declared inside a function can't be seen by other functions!

5. Re-fresh the preview. You should now see a red square moving across
   the screen, but it's leaving a streak behind!!

6. Remember that drawings are always placed one on top of the other. To
   fix this, we need to fill the screen with a background color on every
   frame (we'll use white):

   ```javascript{.numbered data-header="drawing.js" data-added-lines="12" data-line-start="11"}
   function draw() {
       background("white");
       fill("red");
       x += 5;
       y += 5;
       rect(x, y, 50, 50);
   }
   ```
7. After refreshing your preview, you should now see the square moving
   across the screen without the streak:

   ![](.guides/images/square-anim-2.gif){.border}
