# Defining Functions

Let's put this `makeSandwich()` function in a file so we can test it:

1. Copy your `makeSandwich()` function below and paste it inside the
   the javascript file on the left:
    ```javascript {.numbered .allow-copy .pbjcode}
    ```
    ::: infobox warning
    **Note:** When you paste code into the IDE, sometimes the
    indentation won't be correct. To fix this, right-click anywhere in
    your code, and select "Format Document" from the menu.
    :::
2. Re-fresh the preview page below and make sure there are no error messages in the
   Javascript console. 

   ::: infobox
   Notice how we don't see anything output in the console. This is because
   we've only defined the function. We have not yet *called*{.voc} the
   function.
