# Too many sprites?

When you create a sprite, that sprite will continue to exist in the
game's memory, even if it's not visible on the screen. Because your
computer is calculating the position of every sprite on every frame,
this can slow down your whole system after running the game for a while!

The following function can be used in any game code to show the total
number of sprites that are currently in the game:
```javascript {.allow-copy}
function showSpriteCount() {
   textSize(24);
   fill("white");
   text(`sprite count: ${allSprites.length}`, 10, screenHeight - 10);
}

```

1. Copy-and-paste the above function above into your game, just before
   the `draw()` function.
2. Then, at the end of your draw function, call the `showSpriteCount()` function:

   ```javascript {.numbered data-line-start="67" data-added-lines="75-76" data-header="game.js â†’ draw()"}
   function draw() {
       background("black");

       // update sprites
       updateShip();
       updateAsteroids();

       drawSprites();

       showSpriteCount();
   }
   ```
3. Save your code and update your preview. You should see the sprite
   count at the bottom of your screen:

   ![](.guides/images/sprite-count.gif)
4. Leave the game running for a bit and notice how the sprite count
   keeps increasing.
