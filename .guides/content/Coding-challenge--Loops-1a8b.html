# Loops Challenge

1. The script on the left contains two problems.
2. For problem #1, add a *counting loop*{.voc} to output
   the square of every number from `0` to `9` in the console
   (Note: a "square" is just a number multiplied by itself).

   The output in your *javascript console*{.voc} should be:
   ``` {.nohl}
   0
   1
   4
   9
   16
   25
   36
   49
   64
   81
   ```

3. For problem #2, use a *for...of loop*{.voc} to output `"Have a _____
   day"` for each of the adjectives in the array. The output in your
   *javascript console*{.voc} should be:
   ``` {.nohl}
   Have a fantastic day!
   Have a great day!
   Have a super day!
   Have a fun day!
