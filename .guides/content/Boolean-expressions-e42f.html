# Boolean Expressions

A *boolean expression*{.voc} always evaluates to either `true` or `false`.

Let's say you're making a program that tells you what to wear depending
on the weather.

In Javascript, booleans are useful when making decisions, such as using
*if statements*{.voc} or *while loops*{.voc}.

## Try it out!
Try making some boolean expressions in the *javascript console*{.voc}:

::: narrated-code
```javascript {.console}
> let temp = 80;
> temp > 60;
< true
> temp = 40;
> temp > 60;
< false
```
1. Create a variable called `temp` and set it to `80`.
2. Write a *boolean expression* by using the "greater than" operator.
   Because `temp` is more than `80`, the expression is `true`.
3. Now change the temp to something smaller
4. Write the same boolean expression you did earlier.  
   Now that `temp` is not more than `80`, the expression is `false`.
