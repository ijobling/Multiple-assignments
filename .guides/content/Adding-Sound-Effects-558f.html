# Adding Sound Effects

Everyone can agree that no video game is complete without
sound effects.

As with game art, there are many free resources where you can find sound
effects for your game. Game artists often use *tone generators* to create
"retro" sound effects. Tone generators use computer algorithms to
generate sound, giving you an endless variety of effects to choose from.

In this step, we're going to use a tone generator to make three
different sound effects:

- A "regular explosion" sound for the asteroid explosion
- A "big explosion" sound for the ship explosion
- A "laser" sound for when the laser fires

## Using JFXR Sound Generator

[JFXR][1] is a web-based *tone generator*. It has many preset sounds you can
generate for things like explosions, lasers, bounces, jumps, power-ups,
hits, blips, etc.

1. Go to [jfxr.boldidea.org][1].
2. On the left, you'll see a list of sound effects, such as "Laser",
   "Explosion", etc. 
3. Click "Explosion" to generate a random explosion sound.
4. Click "Explosion" again to generate a different sound.
5. You can view previously generated sounds in the list on the
   bottom-left.
6. You can tweak the effect using the controls on the right for
   amplitude, pitch, tone, filters, and output.
7. Once you find a sound you like, click the generated sound in the
   bottom-left menu to rename it. For example, for the "big explosion",
   call it `big-explosion`.
8. Click the "export" button to download the .wav file.
9. Repeat the process until you have "big-explosion",
   "regular-explosion" and "laser" sounds.
