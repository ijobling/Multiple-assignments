# Adding a score board

Next we're going to add a score board to our game that keeps track of two
things:

- `score`: How many asteroids we've hit
- `lives`: How many times we can be hit before our game is over

## Drawing text on the screen
The p5 library gives us the `text()` function which is used to draw text
on the screen. We can use this to draw a simple scoreboard.

The `text()` function takes three parameters:
- The text to draw (a string)
- x (the baseline position of the text)
- y (the left position of the text)

You can use the `textSize()` function to set the font size of the text,
and the `fill()` function to set the color.

1. First, let's add the `score` and `lives` our variables to the game so we
   can keep track of them. We'll start the score at `0`, and we'll give
   the player `3` lives:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-line-start="4" data-added-lines="10-11" data-header="game.js"}
   let assets = {};
   
   let ship;
   let asteroids;
   let lasers;
   
   let score = 0;
   let lives = 3;
   ```
2. Next, define a new function called `drawScoreBoard()` (you can put
   this just above the `draw()` function):
   ```javascript {.numbered data-line-start="167" data-added-lines="167-172" data-header="game.js"}
   function drawScoreBoard() {
       textSize(24);
       fill("white");
       text(`Score: ${score} / Lives: ${lives}`, 24, 40);
   }

   function draw() {
   ```
   ::: infobox
   Notice how the text string uses *backticks*{.voc}. Be sure to use
   these instead of quotes so that the variables inside the string can
   be evaluated.
   :::
3. Next, call the `drawScoreBoard()` function at the end of the
   `draw()` function:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-line-start="181" data-added-lines="182" data-header="game.js â†’ draw()"}
       drawSprites();
       drawScoreBoard();

       showSpriteCount();
   }
   ```
   ::: infobox
   We draw the text after everything else so that it appears on top of
   everything.
   :::
4. Save your code and refresh your preview. You should see the
   score board at the top of the screen that says "Score: 0 / Lives: 3":
