You can also put your javascript code in another file. Sometimes it's
easier to keep your javascript code and HTML code separate.

1. Create a new file called `practice.js` by clicking "File" then "New File".
2. Cut-and-paste the javascript code you created earlier into
   "practice.js". Don't copy the `<script>` tags, just the code between
   them:
   ```javascript {.m8 .s12 .numbered data-header="practice.js"}
   console.log('Hello world!');
   ```
3. Change the `<script>` tag in your HTML file to load the javascript
   file by setting the `src` attribute to your javascript file.
   Make sure there's nothing between the tags.
   ```html {.m8 .s12 .numbered data-header="javascript-practice.html"}
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
    <body>
       <h1>Javascript Practice</h1>

       <script src="practice.js"><\/script>
    </body>
   </html>
   ```
   The `src` attribute of the `<script>` element loads javascript code from
   another file. Your javascript files should always end in `.js`. 
   If your javascript file is in a folder called "js", you would use
   `<script src="js/practice.js">`.
