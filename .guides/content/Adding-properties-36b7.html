# Adding properties to existing objects

You can also construct an object without any properties using `{}`, and add
properties later using the assignment operator.

## Try it out!
Try the following in your javascript console:

```javascript {.console}
> let player = {};
> player.name = "Oscar";
> player.score = 0;
> player.score += 1;
> console.log(`Hello, ${player.name}. Your score is ${player.score}`);
  Hello, Oscar. Your score is 1.
```
