# Variables

Imagine you are making a quiz game, and you want to show this message at
the end.  

You might try something like this: 
```javascript {.s12 .m8}
alert("Congratulations, Alex! Your score is 8.");
```

As a coder, how will you know the name of the person playing your game?
How would you know their score?

The solution to this problem is to use a *variable*{.voc}

## Try it out: Use a variable to store a value

A *variable*{.voc} is like a box. It has a label, and lets you store a
value. You create a variable using: `let variableName = expression`.
The result of the expression on the right side of the `=` will be saved 
in the variable.

1. In the *javascript console*{.voc}, try creating a variable called
   "name", then use it in a string expression:
   ```javascript {.console .s12 .m10}
   > let name = "Alex";
   > alert(`Hello, ${name}!`);
     // You should see an alert box that says ("Hello, Alex!");
   > console.log(`Player ${name} has joined the game.`);
     Player Alex has joined the game.
   ```
{.steps}
   
Once a variable is defined using `let`, it can be used as an *expression*{.voc},
which evaluates to whatever value you assigned to it.

Notice how we can use the variable in different places in our code.

**Don't forget:** When putting variables inside strings, you must use
backticks instead of quotes, like so: `` `Hello, ${name}` `` (the
backtick key [[`]] is to the left of [[1]]).

## Try it out: Change a variable

2. What if we have a new player? Let's re-assign the `name` variable:
   ```javascript {.console .s6 .m7}
   > name = "Maia";
   > alert(`Hello, ${name}!`);
   ```
   You should see an alert box that says "Hello, Maia!"
{.steps .continue}

***Pro Tip:** Press the up arrow key [[â†‘]] in the javascript console to run previous expressions*.

Notice how we don't use `let` when re-assigning a variable. The `let`
keyword is only used when _defining_ the variable for the first time.

When you re-assign a variable, the old value is "thrown away" or
deleted.
