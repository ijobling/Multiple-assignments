# What is JavaScript?

*JavaScript*{.voc} is a programming language that is used on websites to
make them more interactive and dynamic. You can also use it to make
video games, animations, interactive art, or just about anything you can
imagine.

JavaScript runs inside any web browser (for example, Google Chrome), so
it's really easy to get started!

**Javascript is not Java**  
You may have heard of another programming language called *Java*. 
Javascript is actually a completely different language, and much easier
to learn!

## Different ways to run javascript

There are a couple of ways you can run javascript in your browser:

1. You can type code into the javascript Console. This is useful for
   small bits of code you want to try out. This code is not saved and
   goes away when you close your IDE.
2. You can save javascript code into a file, and load it inside a web
   page. This is how you'll make most of your programs.
