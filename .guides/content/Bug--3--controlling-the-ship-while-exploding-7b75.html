# Bug #3: controlling the ship while exploding

If your ship gets hit by an asteroid, there's nothing to stop you from
controlling the ship, even when your ship is exploding. Also, your ship
is still vulnerable to asteroid collisions while it's exploding, which
could cause the player to lose more lives than they should).

## Add the `ship.isExploding` custom property

You can fix this bug in the same way you fixed the asteroid bugs by
adding a custom property called `.isExploding` to the ship.

1. In the `setup()` function, set `ship.isExploding` to false after
   creating the ship:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-line-start="23" data-added-lines="31-33" data-header="game.js → setup()"}
   function setup() {
       createCanvas(screenWidth, screenHeight);
   
       ship = createSprite(assets.ship);
       ship.bottom = screenHeight - 20;
       ship.centerX = screenWidth / 2;
       ship.setCollider("circle");
       ship.addAnimation("explosion", assets.sonicExplosion);

       // Add a custom property to tell if the ship is exploding 
       ship.isExploding = false;
    ```
2. When the ship is hit by an asteroid, set `ship.isExploding` to `true`:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-line-start="93" data-added-lines="98" data-header="game.js → handleShipAsteroidCollision()"}
   function handleShipAsteroidCollision(ship, asteroid) {
       // only explode the ship if the asteroid is not exploding
       if (asteroid.isExploding === false) {
           asteroid.remove();
           ship.changeAnimation("explosion");
           ship.isExploding = true;
           ship.animation.onComplete = shipFinishedExploding;
       }
   }
   ```
3. When the ship finishes exploding, we need to set `ship.isExploding`
   back to false:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-line-start="74" data-added-lines="76" data-header="game.js → shipFinishedExploding()"}
   function shipFinishedExploding() {
       ship.changeAnimation("normal");
       ship.isExploding = false;
   }
   ```
4. Finally, let's wrap the keyboard control and ship collision check in
   an *if-statement*{.voc} to prevent the ship from moving while it's
   exploding. Be sure to indent all the code inside the
   *if-statement*{.voc}!
   ```javascript {.numbered data-line-start="104" data-added-lines="105-106,124" data-header="game.js → updateShip()"}
   function updateShip() {
       // don't allow ship control or collisions while it is exploding
       if (ship.isExploding === false) {
           if (keyIsDown(KEY.RIGHT)) {
               ship.centerX += 10;
           }
           if (keyIsDown(KEY.LEFT)) {
               ship.centerX -= 10;
           }

           // don't allow ship to go out of bounds
           if (ship.left < 0) {
               ship.left = 0;
           }
           if (ship.right > screenWidth) {
               ship.right = screenWidth;
           }

           // Check for collisions between the ship and asteroids 
           ship.overlap(asteroids, handleShipAsteroidCollision);
       }
   }
   ```

   Don't forget to indent all of the lines within the
   *if-statement*{.voc}!

5. Save your code and refresh your preview. Move your ship so that it
   gets hit by an asteroid. Make sure you're not able to control your
   ship while it's exploding.
