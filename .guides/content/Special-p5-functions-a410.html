# Special p5 functions

Your `drawing.js` file is shown on the left. You'll notice there are two 
functions in there. One called `setup()`, and another called `draw()`. 
Every p5 project must have one or both of these functions.

These are "special" functions, because they are **called
automatically** by the p5 library. You don't need to call these functions
yourself. You just need to define them.

## The `setup()` function
This function is automatically run once as soon as the page loads. 
This is where you put any code in here that you want to run in order
to set up your drawing or game.

```javascript {data-header="Example: the setup() function"}
function setup() {
    createCanvas(600, 800);
}
```
The `createCanvas()` function creates the canvas on which you'll do all
of your drawing. The parameters are the `width` and `height` of the
canvas.

## The `draw()` function
The other function, called `draw()`, is run once every "frame", or about
60 times per second. This allows you to make really cool animations.

```javascript {data-header="Example: the draw() function"}
function draw() {
    // draw one frame
}
```

In the next section, we'll learn how to animate using the `draw()`
function.
