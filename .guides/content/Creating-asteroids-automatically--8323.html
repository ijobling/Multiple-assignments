# Creating asteroids automatically 

We don't want to have to call `createAsteroid()` every time we want an
asteroid to appear, so instead we will make them appear automatically
about once every 60 frames (which is about once per second).

## How to do something every Nth frame
We want to call our `createAsteroid()` function every 60th frame.
The p5 library has a variable called `frameCount` which is increased by
1 every time a frame is drawn. 

We can check to see if the *current* frame is divisible by 60 by seeing
if the remainder of `frameCount / 60` is equal to `0`. To do this, we
can use the *remainder operator*{.voc} (which looks like: `%`) instead
of the `/` operator, like so: 
```javascript
frameCount % 60
```
If the result of that expression is `0`, we can call `createAstroid()`,
which will result in an asteroid being created every 60 frames.

## Create the `updateAsteroids` function

Just as we did with our ship, we will now create a function called
`updateAsteroids()` which runs every frame:

1. Define a new function called `updateAsteroids()`. Put this just below
   the `updateShip()` function. Inside this function, create an asteroid
   if the `frameCount` is divisible by `60`:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-header="game.js" data-line-start="54" data-added-lines="54-60"}
   function updateAsteroids() {
       // Create an asteroid every 60th frame
       if (frameCount % 60 === 0) {
           createAsteroid();
       }
   }

   function draw() {
   ```

   If you want your asteroids to be created more slowly, increase the
   number in your `updateAsteroids()` function. For example, `if
   (frameCount % 120 === 0)` will create an asteroid every 120 frames
   (about every two seconds).
   :::
2. Call `updateAsteroids()` in the `draw()` function to make it run
   every frame:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-header="game.js â†’ draw()" data-line-start="61" data-added-lines="66"}
   function draw() {
       background("black");

       // update sprites 
       updateShip();
       updateAsteroids();

       drawSprites();
   }
   ```
4. Save your code and refresh your preview. You should now see your
   asteroids being created automatically, at the rate of 1 per second.
