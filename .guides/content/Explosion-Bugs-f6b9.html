# Explosion Bugs

As we make more and more changes to our game, we increase the chance for
bugs to pop up. When we added our explosion animation feature, we
introduced four new bugs!

## Bug #1: The ship explodes when hit by an exploding asteroid
If you destroy an asteroid as it gets close to your ship, there's a
chance that the asteroid can hit the ship while it's exploding.

We don't want to punish the player for a close call. We need to make
it so that asteroids can't hurt the ship if they're exploding.
