# Adding sprite animations

Sprite asset packs often come with animations that we can use to make
our sprites feel more alive and dynamic.

In your assets folder, there is a set of images named `sonicExplosion`,
numbered 0 through 8 (9 total):

![sonic explosion frames](.guides/images/explosion-animation-frames.png)

Each image is a *frame*{.voc} in an animation. We can use this animation
on our ship to make it explode:
