# Changing animations on a sprite

Next, let's use our *javascript console*{.voc} to test out the
animation.

<!--

Remember that any code you type into the javascript console
is *temporary*, meaning everything gets re-set next time you load the
page. The console is very useful when you want to just test things out
without changing your code.

1. Save your code and refresh your preview. In your *javascript
   console*{.voc}, change the ship's animation to `"explosion"`:
   ```javascript {.console}
   > ship.changeAnimation("explosion");
   ```
   You should now see the ship continuously exploding!

   Animations will continue to loop over and over again until they're
   stopped or changed to something else.
   ::: infobox
   The first parameter to `changeAnimation()` is the *animation
   label*{.voc} that you used in `ship.addAnimation()`.
   :::
2. Change your ship's animation back to `"normal"` to stop the
   explosion:
   ```javascript {.console}
   > ship.changeAnimation("normal");
   ```
   The `"normal"` animation is the default image for your sprite. Even
   though the ship image isn't an animation, the game treats it as a
   single-frame animation.
