# Variable Scope

When creating variables in javascript, a very important rule to remember is:

## Variables declared inside a code block can only be used inside that block. {.big}

A *code block*{.voc} is any code between curly-brackets: `{` and `}`.
The most common type of code block is a function (there are other types
such as conditions and loops which you'll learn about later).

Remember: A variable is *declared*{.voc} using the `let` keyword.

The following example causes an error because `x` and `y` were declared
inside the `setup()` function.

The fix is to move the variable scope outside of the function so they
can be used anywhere:
