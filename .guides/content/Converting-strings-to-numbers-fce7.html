# Converting from strings to numbers 
Let's write a small program that asks the user for two numbers and
returns the sum of those numbers.

1. Open your `practice.js` file and add the following code:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-header="practice.js"}
   let a = prompt("Enter a number");
   let b = prompt("Enter another number");
   let sum = a + b;
   alert(`The sum is ${sum}`);
   ```
2. Re-fresh your preview to run the program. 

3. Enter the numbers `2` and `4`. The program will give you `24` as the
   answer. That's not right! Why do you think this happened?

## prompt() always returns a string
4. Let's use our *javascript console*{.voc} to see what happens when we use
   the `prompt()` function to ask the user for a number:
   ```javascript {.console}
   > prompt("Enter a number");
   < "5"
   ```
   Notice how the resulting number is surrounded by quotes? That means it's
   a string. The `prompt()` function always returns a string.

## Use `Number()` to convert a string to a number
5. We can use the `Number()` function to convert a string to a number. Try
   the following in the javascript console:

   ```javascript {.console}
   > let myNumber = "5";
   > Number(myNumber);
   < 5
   ```
   The number no longer has quotes around it, so we can now use it in math
   expressions.
{.continue}

## Fixing our program
6. Let's fix our program by using the `Number()` function to convert
   the user input to numbers that can be added:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-header="practice.js"}
   let a = prompt("Enter a number");
   let b = prompt("Enter another number");
   let sum = Number(a) + Number(b);
   alert(`The sum is ${sum}`);
   ```
7. Run your program by refreshing the preview and see if it works!
