# Send the asteroid in random directions

Now let's make the game more challenging by making the asteroids
more random! 

We'll make our asteroid appear at a random position at the top of the
screen, and with random speed, direction, and rotation.

## Try it out: the `random()` function

The p5 library gives us a handy function called `random()` that we can
use to randomize anything. You can pass two parameters, a low number and
a high number, and it will give you a random number between the low and
high numbers.

1. Use the *javascript console*{.voc} to practice random numbers:
   ```javascript {.console data-header="Javascript console"}
   > random(0, 10);
   < 4.1249769478
   > random(0, 10);
   < 9.305860439
   > random(50, 60);
   < 53.5049830586
   ```

## Make the asteroid appear at a random location
1. First, let's make our asteroid start off the screen (asteroids don't
   appear out of thin air, do they?)
   ```javascript {.numbered data-line-start="21" data-removed-lines="23" data-added-lines="24" data-header="game.js â†’ createAsteroid()"}
   function createAsteroid() {
       let asteroid = createSprite(assets.bigAsteroid);
       asteroid.top = 0;
       asteroid.bottom = 0;
       asteroid.centerX = screenWidth / 2;
   ```
2. Next, instead of appearing in the center, we want to pick a random
   number between `0` and `screenWidth` so the asteroid appears at a
   random location:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-line-start="21" data-removed-lines="25" data-added-lines="26" data-header="game.js â†’ createAsteroid()"}
   function createAsteroid() {
       let asteroid = createSprite(assets.bigAsteroid);
       asteroid.top = 0;
       asteroid.bottom = 0;
       asteroid.centerX = screenWidth / 2;
       asteroid.centerX = random(0, screenWidth);
   ```
3. Save your code and refresh your preview. Use the 
   *javascript console*{.voc} to create multiple asteroids:
   ```javascript {.console data-header="Javascript console"}
   > createAsteroid();
   > createAsteroid();
   > createAsteroid();
   ```

   You can repeat the last command in the javascript console by pressing
   the up arrow key [[ðŸ •]], followed by [[Enter]]

   You should see asteroids coming straight down from random positions:
