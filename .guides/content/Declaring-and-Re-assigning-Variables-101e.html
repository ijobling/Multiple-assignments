# Declaring and reassigning variables

In javascript, we must *declare*{.voc} variables before using them. You
*declare* a variable using the `let` keyword:

```javascript {.console}
> let score = 0;
```

## You can only declare variables once
If you try to declare a variable twice, you will get an error.

Try the following examples in your javascript console!
```javascript {.console}
> let score = 0;
> console.log(score);
> let score = 5;
X SyntaxError: Identifier 'score' has already been declared
```

## Reassigning variables
If you want to change the variable, you can *reassign*{.voc} it. When
reassigning, you don't need to use the `let` keyword. Just use
the equal sign:

```javascript {.console}
> score = 5;
> alert(`Your score is: ${score}`);
> score = 10;
> alert(`Your new score is: ${score}`);
```
