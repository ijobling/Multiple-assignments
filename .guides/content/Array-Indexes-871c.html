# Array Indexes

You can access a single item in your array using square brackets like
so: `myArray[2]`. The number in brackets is called the *index*{.voc}.
The first item in an array is index **0**. The second item is **1**.

## Try it out!

1. Think of some items to put in a list, and use each item as if it were
   any other variable:

   ```javascript {.console}
   > let animals = ["cat", "bat", "mouse", "elephant"];
   > animals[0];
   < "cat"
   > animals[2];
   < "mouse"
   > animals[1] = "dog";
   > animals;
   < ["cat", "dog", "mouse", "elephant"]
   > `Hello ${animals[0]}`;
   < "Hello cat"
   > `The ${animals[0]} chased the ${animals[2]}`;
   < "The cat chased the mouse"
   ```

2. If you try to use an index that exceeds the number of values in your
   list, the value will be `undefined`:
   ```javascript {.console}
   > console.log(animals[5]);
   < undefined;
   ```
 
3. You can get the length of an array using `.length`:
   ```javascript {.console}
   > animals.length;
   < 4
   ```
   
4. Using `.length` allows you to get the last item in an array. Remember
   that the 4th item in our `animals` array has the index `3` (because
   indexes start at 0). If the length of the array is unknown, you can
   use `animals.length - 1` to get the last index.
   ```javascript {.console}
   > animals.length - 1;
   < 3
   > animals[animals.length - 1];
   < "elephant"
   ```
