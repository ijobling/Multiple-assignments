# Counting loops
A counting loop is used to repeat something a given number of times. It
uses the `for` keyword followed by parenthesis and a code block.

![counting-loop diagram](.guides/images/counting-loop.png) {.s12}

The stuff in parenthesis is in 3 parts:
1: the initializer - runs at the beginning of the loop
2: the condition - tells the loop when to stop
3: the incrementer - runs at the end of each iteration


## Try it out!
Copy-and-paste the following code snippet into your javascript console
and press [[Enter]] to run it:

```javascript {.allow-copy .counting-loop-example .no-overflow}
for (let i=0; i<10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
console.log('All done!');
```

<!-- FIXME: this is not working well.
Press "Show me" below to see how the loop works:

[Show me](){.btn .start-introjs data-target=".counting-loop-example"}
1. We start with the `for` keyword {data-select=".line-1" data-select-re="/for/"}
2. This is how we control the loop. It's defined in three parts. {data-select=".line-1" data-select-re="/\\(.+\\)/"}
3. For the initializer, we set a variable i equal to 0. {data-select=".line-1" data-select-re="/\<.+\>let.+ i=[^;]+;/"}
4. For the condition, we want to loop to run only if i is less than 10.
5. For the incrementer, we increase i by 1 each time
6. This code will be run each time i is incremented
