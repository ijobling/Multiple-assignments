# Removing the asteroid after the explosion

We need to make it so that the asteroid sprite is removed *after* the
explosion finishes playing. We can use the `Animation.onComplete`
property to trigger a custom function when the animation completes. 

When the animation reaches the last frame, this function will be called
with a parameter that represents the animation itself. This allows you
to access the sprite associated with the animation using
`animation.sprite`.

1. Write a new function called `asteroidFinishedExploding` with a
   parameter called `animation` (you can put this below the
   `shipFinishedExploding()` function:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-header="game.js" data-line-start="68" data-added-lines="72-73"}
   function shipFinishedExploding() {
       ship.changeAnimation("normal");
   }

   function asteroidFinishedExploding(animation) {
   }
   ```
2. Inside that function, get the asteroid from the `animation.sprite`
   property, then remove the sprite.
   ```javascript {.numbered data-header="game.js → asteroidFinishedExploding()" data-line-start="72" data-added-lines="73-74"}
   function asteroidFinishedExploding(animation) {
       let asteroid = animation.sprite;
       asteroid.remove();
   }
   ```
3. In the collision handler, delete the `asteroid.remove()` line.
   Instead, set the `onComplete` property of the asteroid animation to
   point to your function:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-header="game.js → handleLaserAsteroidCollision()" data-line-start="77" data-added-lines="81" data-removed-lines="80"}
   function handleLaserAsteroidCollision(laser, asteroid) {
       laser.remove();
       asteroid.changeAnimation("explosion");
       asteroid.remove();
       asteroid.animation.onComplete = asteroidFinishedExploding;
   }
   ```
4. Save your code and refresh the preview. Try shooting an asteroid with
   one laser blast. The asteroid should now explode and then disappear.
