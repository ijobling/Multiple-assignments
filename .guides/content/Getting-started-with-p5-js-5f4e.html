# Getting started with p5.js

To get started, we've created 2 new files in your editor:

* `drawing.html`
* `drawing.js`

The `drawing.html` file contains the basic requirements needed to load p5.js. You'll see it has two `<script>` elements. One loads the p5.js library, the other loads our `drawing.js` file.

The `drawing.js` file contains the code necessary to start any p5.js project. 

In the following steps, we'll be working strictly with the `drawing.js` file.
