# Function Parameters

It would be much better if we didn't have to repeat code any time we
want our function to behave differently. That's why we have *function
parameters*{.voc}.

## Using Parameters
Function *parameters*{.voc} allow us to pass values into a function to
make it behave differently.

1. First, let's update our **function call** at the bottom of our
   script. Here we'll pass the flavor `"grape"` to the function:

   ```javascript {.numbered data-removed-lines="9" data-line-start="7"}
   }
   
   makeSandwich();
   makeSandwich("grape");
   ```

2. Next, we need to update our *function definition*{.voc} to accept a
   *parameter*{.voc} named `jellyType`:

   ```javascript {.numbered data-removed-lines="1" data-line-start="1"}
   function makeSandwich() {
   function makeSandwich(jellyType) {
   ```

   ::: infobox 
   *Parameters*{.voc} are just variable names that go in the parentheses
   of the function definition. You can put as many parameters as you
   want, separated by commas.
   :::

3. Finally, let's update the "jelly" step to include the `jellyType`
   variable. You'll need to use a *template string*{.voc} with backticks
   to use the variable in the string:

   ```javascript {.numbered data-line-start="4" data-removed-lines="4"}
   console.log('Put jelly on the other slice');
   console.log(`Put ${jellyType} jelly on the other slice`);
   ```

4. Save and preview your page. The Javascript console should now show
   the steps with grape jelly.

5. Add a second *function call*{.voc}, but this time with strawberry:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-line-start="7" data-added-lines="10"}
   }
   
   makeSandwich("grape");
   makeSandwich("strawberry");
   ```
   After running your code again you should see the steps repeated, once
   for grape, and again for strawberry.
