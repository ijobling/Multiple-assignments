# Code Challenge: Turtle Square

![turtle](.guides/images/turtle.png){.float-right .s3}
Imagine you have a turtle whose job is to draw pictures. It has a pen
that it can lift up and down. It also knows a few commands like "turn
left", "turn right", and "move forward".

To move forward 100 pixels, you use the command `turtle.forward(100)`.
To turn left 90Â°, use you use the command `turtle.left(90)`

## Challenge: fix the program
The script on the left asks the user for a number,
then it uses the turtle to draw a square of that size. 

But, the program is broken! It's your job to fix it.

## Requirements
Try your best to fix the program! If working correctly, it _should_ do
the following:

- Ask the user for a size
- Draw a square using the given size for each side
- Be sure to test your program by entering different sizes!

When you're ready, click "Open Preview" below to run the program.
The preview will open in a new tab. To switch back to this guide, 
click the first tab above the preview.

[Open Preview](/.guides/p/#preview=/02-expressions-and-variables/turtle-squares.html&consoleOpen=true){.btn .preview data-panel="1"}

**To re-run your program**, click the refresh button ![](.guides/images/refresh-preview.png) on the preview panel.

::: infobox question
There is already one variable for `size`. Can you think of another
variable that you could define?
