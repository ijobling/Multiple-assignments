# Code Challenge: Turtle Houses

The javascript file on the left uses the *turtle*{.voc} to draw four houses. But, the program is broken! 

The end of the script calls `drawHouse()` four different times, but the `drawHouse()` function is not defined (you should see an error in the console when you preview the page).

Click "Open Preview" below to open the code preview in a new tab, then switch back to this tab to read the instructions.

**Your goal** is to create a `drawHouse()` function that allows you to draw houses with different colors for the base and roof.

## Requirements
1. Create a function called `drawHouse` and put the house-drawing code
   inside it. 
   
   The house-drawing code is every line between 
   `// BEGIN HOUSE-DRAWING CODE` and `// END HOUSE-DRAWING CODE`.
   ::: infobox warning
   Warning: do not move the `const turtle = new Turtle()` line in your
   function, as it will clear the drawing each time it is run. Leave
   that line at the top of the script.` 
   :::
2. The result should look like this:

3. Update your function definition to accept the following parameters:
   - `baseColor`
   - `roofColor`
4. Use `turtle.color(colorName)` in your function to change the color at
   the appropriate times (before drawing the base, and before drawing
   the roof). Be sure to use the correct variable name for the color.
5. Update your function calls to pass different colors for the base and
   roof. See [here][1] for a list of color names you can use.
6. Your houses should now all have different color bases and roofs.
