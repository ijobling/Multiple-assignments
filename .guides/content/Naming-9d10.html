# Naming things

There are a few rules to remember when naming things such as variables:

* No spaces
* Only use letters, numbers, `_` , and `$`.
* Cannot start with numbers

There are several techniques we can use to get around the problem of no
spaces:

## Using `camelCase`
When naming a variable that has multiple words, use *camelCase*{.voc}.
With camelCase, we capitalize the first letter of each word. Usually,
the first letter is lowercase.

```javascript
let firstName = "Robyn";
```

## Using `ALL_CAPS` for constant values
Another way to name variables using `ALL_CAPS`. However, this usually
has a special meaning in programming. We use `ALL_CAPS` to show 
that a variable has a *constant*{.voc} value and does not change. These
variables are also declared using the `const` keyword instead of `let`.

```javascript
const THIS_IS_A_CONSTANT = "I don't change.";
```
