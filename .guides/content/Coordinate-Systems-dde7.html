# Coordinate Systems

Before we start drawing, we need to take a quick refresher on coordinate
systems, and how things are a bit different when drawing 2D graphics.

A *coordinate system*{.voc} lets you use numbers to describe a position
on a flat surface (for example, a map or a computer screen).

[watch this 6-minute video](https://youtu.be/pAlq9fFwtus){target="_blank"}
for a refresher.

You may have learned in math class that a coordinate plane looks like
this:

![y-up coordinates](.guides/images/y-up-coords.png) {.s8 .m6}

This is sometimes called *Y-up*{.voc} coordinates because Y goes up as it
increases.

## Y-down Coordinates in 2D graphics

2D computer graphics uses a slightly different coordinate system called
*Y-down*{.voc}, where Y starts at the top of the plane and goes down as it
increases:

![y-down coordinates](.guides/images/y-down-coords.png) {.s8 .m6}

You'll have to always keep this in mind when making 2D graphics. Just
remember:

* If you **increase** Y, things go down toward the bottom.
* If you **decrease** Y, things go up toward the top.
