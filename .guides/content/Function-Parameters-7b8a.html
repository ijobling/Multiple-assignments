# Function Parameters

Right now, our robot can only make one kind of sandwich. What if we want it to use different types of jelly?

We _could_ write two functions, one called `makeGrapePBJ()` and another called `makeStrawberryPBJ()`. But that means we would have to repeat a bunch of code.

Can you spot the difference between both examples below?  Which lines are the same? Which are different?

```javascript {.numbered data-header="This is just an example, no need to type this"}
function makeSandwich() {
  console.log('Get 2 slices of bread');
  console.log('Put peanut butter on one');
  console.log('Put grape jelly on the other');
  console.log('Put the two slices together');
  console.log('Serve w/ a glass of cold milk');
}
```
```javascript {.numbered data-header="This is just an example, no need to type this"}
function makeSandwich() {
  console.log('Get 2 slices of bread');
  console.log('Put peanut butter on one');
  console.log('Put strawberry jelly on the other');
  console.log('Put the two slices together');
  console.log('Serve w/ a glass of cold milk');
}
```

As you can see, there is only one word that is different. Imagine if we had a lot of different flavors of jelly. We would have to duplicate a lot of code!
