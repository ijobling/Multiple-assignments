# Exploding asteroids

Hitting an asteroid would be much more satisfying if we could watch it
explode. Let's add a new animation to the asteroid sprite, similar to
what we did with the ship explosion.

## Steps to add an animation
As a refresher, here's the steps to add an animation to a sprite:

1. Load the animation assets in the `preload()` function using
   `loadAnimation()`.
2. Add the animation to the sprite with an *animation label*{.voc} as
   soon as the sprite is created.
3. Change the sprite's current animation using the *animation
   label*{.voc} somewhere in your code.

## Add the animation to the asteroid

We'll going to use the `regularExplosion` animation for our asteroid.

1. In your `preload()` function, load the `regularExplosion` animation
   into the `assets` object:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-header="game.js → preload()" data-line-start="10" data-added-lines="19-20"}
   function preload() {
       // images
       assets.ship = loadImage("assets/playerShip1_blue.png");
       assets.bigAsteroid = loadImage("assets/asteroid_big1.png");
       assets.laser = loadImage("assets/laserBlue01.png");
   
       // animations
       assets.sonicExplosion = loadAnimation(
           "assets/sonicExplosion00.png", "assets/sonicExplosion08.png");
       assets.regularExplosion = loadAnimation(
           "assets/regularExplosion00.png", "assets/regularExplosion08.png");
   }
   ```
2. In the `createAsteroid()` function, add an animation with the label
   `"explosion"`:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-header="game.js → createAsteroid()" data-line-start="61" data-added-lines="63-65"}
       // Add the newly created asteroid to the sprite group
       asteroids.add(asteroid);

       // Add the explosion animation
       asteroid.addAnimation("explosion", assets.regularExplosion);
   }
   ```
3. Next, let's change to the `"explosion"` animation when the laser hits
   the asteroid.
   ```javascript {.numbered data-header="game.js → handleLaserAsteroidCollision()" data-line-start="72" data-added-lines="74"}
   function handleLaserAsteroidCollision(laser, asteroid) {
       laser.remove();
       asteroid.changeAnimation("explosion");
       asteroid.remove();
   }
   ```
4. Save your code and refresh the preview.

   Notice how if you shoot an asteroid, it still just disappears without
   exploding. That's because we removed the asteroid immediately after
   starting the animation. We didn't even get a chance to see the first
   frame of the explosion.
