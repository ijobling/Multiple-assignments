# More Array Methods

Try these other array methods in your javascript console:

## `Array.includes()`
You can use the `.includes()` method in a conditional statement to test
if an item is in an array:

```javascript {.console}
> let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
> colors.includes("purple");
< false
> colors.includes("green");
< true
```

## `Array.join()`
This method is handy when you want to convert the items in an array to a
string which is separated by something (like a comma):

```javascript {.console}
> let things = [ "lions", "tigers", "bears" ];
> things.join(", ");
< "lions, tigers, bears";
> things.join(" and ");
> "lions and tigers and bears";
> console.log(`${things.join(" and ")}, oh my!`);
  "lions and tigers and bears, oh my!"
```

## `String.split()`
You can also split a string into an array. The first argument is the
character you want to split on:
```javascript {.console}
> let sentence = "I am very smart";
> let words = sentence.split(" ");
> console.log(words);
  ["I", "am", "very", "smart"];
> let groceries = "milk,fruit,bread";
> let list = groceries.split(",");
> console.log(list);
< [ "milk", "fruit", "bread" ];
> groceries = "milk and fruit and bread";
> list = groceries.split(" and ");
> console.log(list);
< [ "milk", "fruit", "bread" ];
```
