# Detecting Collisions

![collision](.guides/images/collision.png){.float-right}

The asteroids are currently passing right through our ship. This game
won't be much fun if our ship doesn't blow up when it hits an asteroid.

The p5.game library gives us an easy way to detect collisions. You
simply define a function that you want to be called when two sprites
collide (the "collision handler"), and then use the `Sprite.overlap()`
or `Group.overlap()` method to make the game watch for collisions. When
a collision does happen, your function gets called with the colliding
sprites as arguments.

You can detect collisions between the following objects:

- Between two individual sprites
- Between an individual sprite and any sprite in a *sprite group* 
- Between any sprite in two different sprite groups

## A simple collision handler for ship-to-asteroid collisions

We want to handle a collision between the ship and any sprite in the
`asteroids` group.

1. To do this, create a *collision handler*{.voc} function just before
   your `updateShip()` function.
   ```javascript {.numbered data-header="game.js" data-line-start="37" data-added-lines="37-40"}
   function handleShipAsteroidCollision() {
       console.log("An asteroid is overlapping the ship");
   }

   function updateShip() {
   ```
2. Next, we need something that checks every frame to see if an asteroid
   is overlapping the ship, and executes our handler function if
   something is overlapping. Add the following line at the end of your
   `updateShip()` function:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-header="game.js â†’ updateShip()" data-line-start="53" data-added-lines="56-58"}
       if (ship.right > screenWidth) {
           ship.right = screenWidth;
       }

       // Check for collisions between the ship and asteroids 
       ship.overlap(asteroids, handleShipAsteroidCollision);
   }
   ```
3. Save your code and refresh your preview. Make your ship collide with
   an asteroid, and watch the *javascript console*{.voc} during the
   collision:

   Notice that our collision handler function gets called for **every
   frame** that an asteroid is overlapping the ship.
