# Adding asteroids to the game

Next we will add asteroids to our game. Our asteroids will appear at a
random location at the top of the screen and fly in random directions
toward the bottom of the screen.

## Add a `createAsteroid()` function

We're going to make a function called `createAsteroid()`, that way any
time we want to make an asteroid, we can just call that function. 

1. In your `preload()` function, add a line that loads the asteroid
   image into the `assets` object:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-line-start="8" data-added-lines="10" data-header="game.js → preload()"}
   function preload() {
       assets.ship = loadImage("assets/playerShip1_blue.png");
       assets.bigAsteroid = loadImage("assets/asteroid_big1.png");
   }
   ```
2. Create a new function called `createAsteroid()`, just after the
   `setup()` function:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-line-start="12" data-added-lines="19-21" data-header="game.js"}
   function setup() {
       createCanvas(screenWidth, screenHeight);
   
       ship = createSprite(assets.ship);
       ship.bottom = screenHeight - 20;
       ship.centerX = screenWidth / 2;
   }

   function createAsteroid() {
   }
   ```
3. Inside the function, create a new asteroid sprite and place at the
   top of the screen in the middle. You can easily get the middle of the
   screen by dividing `screenWidth` in half:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-line-start="20" data-added-lines="21-23" data-header="game.js → createAsteroid()"}
   function createAsteroid() {
       let asteroid = createSprite(assets.bigAsteroid);
       asteroid.top = 0;
       asteroid.centerX = screenWidth / 2;
   }
   ```
4. Save and refresh the preview. You won't see the asteroid yet, because
   your `createAsteroid()` function isn't being called.
5. Open your *javascript console*{.voc}, and test your function:
   ```javascript {.console}
   > createAsteroid();
   ```
   You should now see an asteroid appear at the top of the screen.
