# Code Challenge: Snowman Sunset

Your next challenge will be to draw a scene with a snowman as the sun
sets behind the horizon:

## Instructions

1. The `snowman-sunset.js` file is opened to the left. You'll notice
   it has the basic structure of a p5.js drawing project.
2. Click "Open Preview" below to open a preview in a new tab 
   (it will be blank), then switch back to this tab.  
   [Open Preview](/.guides/p/#preview=/05-drawing/snowman-sunset.html&consoleOpen){.btn .preview data-panel="1"}
3. Inside the `draw()` function, set the background to `"skyblue"`. 
   Refresh your preview to make sure that worked.

   It's a good idea to preview your code on each step. If you try to code
   the whole thing without testing along the way, it will be **much** more
   difficult to fix your bugs!

4. Next, draw a yellow `100 x 100` ellipse `80` pixels from the
   left and `60` pixels from the top.
5. Draw the ground using a rectangle and the color `"darkgreen"`.  It
   should be `100` pixels tall and the same width as the screen.
6. Draw the bottom of the snowman with a white `150 x 150` ellipse, which
   is in the center of the screen and `100` pixels from the bottom of
   the screen.
7. Draw the middle of the snowman using a `100 x 100` ellipse,
   positioned `200` pixels from the bottom of the screen.
8. Draw the head of the snowman using a `75 x 75` ellipse, positioned
   `280` pixels from the bottom of the screen.
9. Animate the sun, making it move down `1` pixel per frame. *Hint: you
   will need to use a variable for the `y` position and increment it in
   the `draw()` function.*

## Check your work

Your animation should look like the example at the top!
