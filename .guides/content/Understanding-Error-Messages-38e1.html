# Understanding Error Messages

Sometimes the computer will encounter an error in your code. An error
will cause your program to stop immediately.

## Try it out: Making mistakes
Try causing an error to see what happens:

1. In the `practice.js` file, pretend you misspelled the word "console" by 
   changing the line to:
   ```javascript
   konsole.log("Hello world!");
   ```
2. Refresh your preview.
3. When the page loads, you should see an error in your javascript
   console that looks like this:
   ![javascript-error-example](.guides/images/js-error.png)

   `ReferenceError` usually happens when something isn't defined. That
   means the computer can't find what you've typed. If you get this, 
   be sure to check your spelling!

4. Experiment by trying to cause different errors! What error messages
   did you see? What do you think they mean?
 
## What to do in case of an error:
Sometimes error messages can be really long, but don’t worry! You
don’t need to understand the whole thing. Here are some tips to help
you find the bug quickly:

- Carefully read the first line of the error message.
- Look at the file and line number in the error message. Check your code on that line.
- Use `console.log()` statements to inspect variables, or use your
  browser's debugging feature (if available).
- If you’re still stuck, look at the "Troubleshooting" chapter in your
  javascript reference.
- Copy-and-paste the last line of the error into the search bar on
  [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com).
- Ask a friend or mentor for help!
