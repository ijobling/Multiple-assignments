# Incrementing and decrementing numbers

*Incrementing*{.voc} means **to increase** something, specifically a
number. *Decrementing*{.voc} means **to decrease** something.

If we have a variable that contains a number, we can increase it by
assigning the variable to itself plus 1.

## Try it out!
Try the following in your console:

```javascript {.console}
> let n = 0;
> n = n + 1;
< 1
> n = n + 1;
< 2
> n = n + 1;
< 3
> n = n - 1;
< 2
> n = n - 1;
< 1
```

Notice how each time we run `n = n + 1`, the number goes up. That's
because each time, we're adding `1` to the value of `n`, and storing the
result back into `n`. So, 1 gets replaced with `1+1` which is `2`,
and so on.


## Shortcuts
A shortcut for `n = n + 1` is `n++`. You can also use `n--`.

Try the following in your console:

```javascript {.console}
> let i = 0;
> i++;
> console.log(i);
  1
> i++;
> console.log(i);
  2
> i++;
> console.log(i);
  3
> i--;
> connsole.log(i);
  2
> i--;
> connsole.log(i);
  1
```

## Bigger increments
You can also increment by bigger numbers using `n += 2` or `n -= 2`:

Try the following in your console:

```javascript {.console}
> let j = 0;
> j += 2;
> console.log(j);
  2
> j += 2;
> console.log(j);
  4
> console.log(j);
  6
> j -= 2;
> console.log(j);
  4
> j -= 2;
> console.log(j);
  2
```
