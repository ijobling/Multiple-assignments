# Code Comments

Code *comments*{.voc} are a way to add notes to your code. These can be
notes for yourself, or for other people who are reading your code.

## Single-line comments

To write a single-line comment in your code, begin the line with two
forward-slashes `//`. The following is an example of well-commented
code:

```javascript
// get the width and height from the user 
let width = prompt("Enter width");
let height = prompt("Enter height");

// convert width and height to numbers
width = Number(width);
height = Number(height);

// calculate the area, which is width times height
let area = width * height;
```

You can also write comments at the end of a line, like so:
```javascript
alert(`The area is ${area}`); // display the area in an alert box
```

Your IDE will automatically color comments differently from the rest of
your code, which makes it easier to read.
