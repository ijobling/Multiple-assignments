# Putting sprites into motion

Every sprite has different properties that can be used to control their
motion automatically. This makes things much easier because you don't
have to do the animations yourself.

We want our asteroids to move straight down. We can do this by
controlling its *speed*{.voc} and *direction*{.voc}.

## Setting the asteroid's speed

1. In your `createAsteroid()` function, use `asteroid.setSpeed(5)` to
   set the asteroid's speed to `5`. This will automatically move the
   asteroid by 5 pixels every frame.
   ```javascript {.numbered data-line-start="21" data-added-lines="25"}
   function createAsteroid() {
       let asteroid = createSprite(assets.bigAsteroid);
       asteroid.top = 0;
       asteroid.centerX = screenWidth / 2;
       asteroid.setSpeed(5);
   }
   ```
2. Save your code and refresh your preview. Use the *javascript
   console*{.voc} to create another asteroid:
   ```javascript  {.console}
   > createAsteroid();
   ```
   You should see your asteroid moving to the right.
