# Getting Started
In the remaining lessons, we will work step-by-step to build a "space
shooter" game, where you control a ship that's flying through a
field of asteroids flying in random directions:

## Project files

On the left, you'll see two files. One is `index.html` (top) and the other is `game.js` (bottom). 

### index.html

The `index.html` file is what gets loaded first by the browser. That file then loads `game.js` file using a `<script>` element.

Notice how we have a couple of new scripts in our HTML file, one
called `p5.sound.min.js`, and another called `p5.game.js`. These are
extensions to p5.js that makes it easier to build games.
:::

This basic set up contains everything need to build a simple 2D game. You won't have to make any changes to `index.html` until you're ready to move onto more advanced stuff. 

### game.js

We'll do our game coding inside `game.js`. You'll see that it we've added the basic *p5.js* structure, including the `preload()`, `setup()`, `draw()` functions.

Our game's screen size is 600 x 800. You can change this later once you've finished building the game and want to customize it, but for now we recommend keeping it as-is.
