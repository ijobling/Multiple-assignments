# Positioning Sprites

By default, sprites are positioned with their center at the top-left of
the screen. To fix this, we need to set the sprite's *position*{.voc}.

## Position properties
Sprite objects have the following properties that can be used for
setting position on the screen:

![sprite position properties](.guides/images/sprite-position-properties.png)

| Property   | Description                            |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- | 
| `.centerX` | The sprite's center on the x-axis      |
| `.centerY` | The sprite's center on the y-axis      |
| `.left`    | The sprite's left edge on the x-axis   |
| `.top`     | The sprite's top edge on the y-axis    |
| `.right`   | The sprite's right edge on the x-axis  |
| `.bottom`  | The sprite's bottom edge on the y-axis |

{.table}

## Try it out!
Try some of the following commands in your *javascript console*{.voc} to
see how these properties work! You should see your ship update as you
type each command into the console.

::: infobox .warning
In order to see the effect of typing a command, you may need to switch
back-and-forth between this lesson guide and your preview.

Type the command in the console, switch to your preview, then click back
in the console and hit [[Enter]] to run the command and see the effect.

| Command                            | Description                                                          |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ship.left = 0;`                   | Put the ship's left edge at the far left of the screen               |
| `ship.top = 0;`                    | Put the ship's edge top at the top of the screen                     |
| `ship.left = 150;`                 | Put the ship's left edge `150` pixels from the left of the screen    |
| `ship.bottom = 400;`               | Put the ship's bottom edge `400` pixels from the top of the screen   |
| `ship.bottom = screenHeight - 20;` | Put the ship's bottom edge `20` pixels from the bottom of the screen |
| `ship.centerX = screenWidth / 2;`  | Put the ship's center in the middle of the screen                    |

{.table}

## Set your ship's initial position
1. Now that you know how to use position properties, update your code to position
   the ship in the center of the screen, 20 pixels from the bottom:

   ```javascript {.numbered data-line-start="12" data-added-lines="16-17" data-header="game.js â†’ setup()"}
   function setup() {
       createCanvas(screenWidth, screenHeight);
       
       ship = createSprite(assets.ship);
       ship.bottom = screenHeight - 20;
       ship.centerX = screenWidth / 2;
   }
   ```
   ::: infobox
   Any time you want to calculate the center position of the screen, you
   can use `screenWidth / 2` to get the center on the x-axis, and
   `screenHeight / 2` to get the center on the y-axis.
   :::
2. Refresh your preview. You should now see the ship positioned at the bottom
   of the screen in the center.
