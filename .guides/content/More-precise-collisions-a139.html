# More precise collisions

Watch the animation below. Notice how the asteroid disappears before it
touches the ship. Why is that?

## Debug mode

We can get a better look at what's happening if we enable "debug mode"
on our sprites. Sprites and sprite groups have a property called `debug`
that, when set to `true`, shows an outline around each sprite. This
outline is the sprite's *collider*{.voc} shape.

1. Run the following command in your console to enable debug mode on all
   sprites:
   ```javascript {.console}
   > allSprites.debug = true;
   ```
2. Now watch as asteroids collide on the corner of the ship:

   ![](.guides/images/collision-bad-collider-debug.gif)

   As you can see, a rectangle is used to determine whether or not two
   sprites are overlapping. Collisions are detected based on the 
   *collider shape*{.voc}. The default collider shape for sprites is a
   rectangle.
