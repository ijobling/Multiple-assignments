# Comparison Operators

There are many operators you can use in an expression to compare two
values. 

Try making some boolean expressions using the following comparison
operators in your javascript console:

| Operator | Expression is true if...                                       |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `===`    | Both values are **equal**                                      |
| `!==`    | Both values are **not equal**                                  |
| `<`      | The left value is **less than** the right value                |
| `>`      | The left value is **greater than** the right value             |
| `<=`     | The left value is **less than or equal to** the right value    |
| `>=`     | The left value is **greater than or equal to** the right value |

{.table}

```javascript {.console}
> let a = 2;
> let b = 5;
> let c = 5;
> a === b
< false
> a !== b
< true
> a < b
< true
> a > b
< false
> a >= c
< false
> b >= c
< true
> b > c
< false
```

::: infobox warning
Notice how `===` uses 3 equal signs, and `!==` uses 2 equal signs. This
is different from other programming languages. You can use the shorter
versions, `==` and `!=`, but these behave a bit differently and may give
you unexpected results. It's usually best to use `===` and `!==`.
