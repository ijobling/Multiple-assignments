# For-of loop
A *for-of loop*{.voc} is one of the most common loops you will use in
Javascript. It allows you to run a block of code for each item of an
array.

## Try it out!
Copy-and-paste the following code snippet in your javascript console and
press [[Enter]]:

```javascript {.allow-copy .for-of-example .no-overflow}
let people = ["Jim", "Pam", "Michael", "Dwight"];

for (let person of people) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${person}!`);
}
```

The console should output a sentence for each word.

Press the "show me" button below to see how it works!

[Show me](){.btn .start-introjs data-target=".for-of-example"}

1. Here we've defined an array of people. {data-select=".line-1"}
2. This is our loop. It has the keyword "for" followed by parentheses,
   and then a code block. {data-select-lines="3-5"}
3. The syntax is "for (a of b)", where "a" is a variable declaration and
   "b" is the list we want to loop over. {data-select=".line-3"}
4. Here we've defined the variable name we want to use for each item.
   This variable will change to the next item on each 
   iteration. {data-select=".line-3" data-select-re="/\<[^\>]+\>let\<\/.+\> person/"}
5. Here we put the name of the array we want to loop through. {data-select=".line-3" data-select-re="/\<[^\>]+\>of\<\/.+\> people/"}
6. This is our code block. We can put as much code in here as we want.
   This code will run 4 times because there are 4 items in the 
   array. {data-select=".line-4"}
{.tour-steps data-target=".for-of-example"}
