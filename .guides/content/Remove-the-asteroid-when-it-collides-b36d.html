# Remove the asteroid when it collides

Our first goal is to make the asteroid disappear when it hits the ship.

When your collision handler is called, the two sprites that collided are
passed to the function as *parameters*{.voc}. This helps us know _which_
sprites collided. 

1. Update your collision handler function to accept two
   *parameters*{.voc}, one for the ship, and the other for the asteroid
   that's colliding.
   ```javascript {.numbered data-header="game.js → handleShipAsteroidCollision()" data-line-start="37" data-removed-lines="37" data-added-lines="38"}
   function handleShipAsteroidCollision() {
   function handleShipAsteroidCollision(ship, asteroid) {
       console.log("An asteroid is overlapping the ship");
   }
   ```
2. Next, replace the `console.log()` line with `asteroid.remove()` to
   remove the asteroid sprite.
   ```javascript {.numbered data-header="game.js → handleShipAsteroidCollision()" data-line-start="37" data-removed-lines="38" data-added-lines="39"}
   function handleShipAsteroidCollision(ship, asteroid) {
       console.log("An asteroid is overlapping the ship");
       asteroid.remove()
   }
   ```
3. Save your code and refresh the preview. Try colliding with an
   asteroid. The asteroid should now disappear as soon as it touches
   your ship:
