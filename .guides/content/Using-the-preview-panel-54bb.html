# Using the preview panel

To preview your game, click the "Preview with console" button in the main menu. This will open a preview in a new tab.

You can choose which side of the screen you want your preview on. If you want to have your preview on the right, simply drag the preview tab over to the tab bar on the right side of the screen.

## Try it out!

Open the preview, and move it to the right side of the screen. Put the preview on whichever side you prefer.

You'll also notice a javascript console below the preview. The console allows you to interact with your code in real-time. 

You can click the console header to hide or show the console. You can also drag the bar to resize it.
