# Add "play again" functionality

Most players wouldn't want to give up after one game. Let's add an
option to allow the users to play again by pressing the [[Space]] key.

In order to do this, we need a way to re-set the game so the `score` is
`0`, `lives` is `3`, and the ship is positioned back in the center.

1. Add a new function called `resetGame()`. Inside the function, set the
   `score` to `0`, `lives` to `3`, and put the ship in the center of the
   screen. You'll also need call `asteroids.removeAll()` to remove all
   asteroids.

   You can put this function just after the `setup()` function:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-line-start="52" data-added-lines="52-61" data-header="game.js"}
   function resetGame() {
       // re-set score, lives, and ship position
       score = 0;
       lives = 3;
       ship.centerX = screenWidth / 2;

       // remove all asteroids
       asteroids.removeAll();
   }

   function createLaser() {
   ```
2. Save your code and refresh your preview. Play your game until you see
   the "game over" screen. In your *javascript console*{.voc}, run the
   `resetGame()` function, and set `gameOver` to `false` to hide the
   "game over" screen. Your points, lives, and ship position should
   re-set when you run the function.
   ```javascript {.console}
   > resetGame();
   > gameOver = false;
   ```
3. Add some text to the game over screen that says "Press SPACE to try
   again!":
   ```javascript {.numbered data-line-start="198" data-added-lines="204-205" data-header="game.js → drawGameOverScreen()"}
   function drawGameOverScreen() {
       background("black");
       textAlign(CENTER);
       fill("white");
       textSize(40);
       text("GAME OVER", screenWidth/2, screenHeight/2);
       textSize(20);
       text("Press SPACE to try again!", screenWidth/2, screenHeight/2 + 100);
   }
   ```
3. In the same function, and an *if-statement*{.voc} that calls
   `resetGame()` if the [[space]] key is pressed, and sets `gameOver` to
   `false`:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-line-start="198" data-added-lines="207-211" data-header="game.js → drawGameOverScreen()"}
   function drawGameOverScreen() {
       background("black");
       textAlign(CENTER);
       fill("white");
       textSize(40);
       text("GAME OVER", screenWidth/2, screenHeight/2);
       textSize(20);
       text("Press SPACE to try again!", screenWidth/2, screenHeight/2 + 100);

       if (keyWentDown(KEY.SPACE)) {
           resetGame();
           gameOver = false;
       }
   }
   ```
4. Save your code and refresh your preview. Lose the game to test out
   your game over screen. The game should re-set when you hit the
   [[Space]] key.
