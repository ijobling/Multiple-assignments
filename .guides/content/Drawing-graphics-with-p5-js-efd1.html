# Drawing graphics with p5.js

![p5.js logo](.guides/images/p5js.png)

*p5.js*{.voc} is a *library*{.voc} that makes it easy to draw
graphics and animations in javascript.

A library is just a javascript file written by someone else. You can
load this script in your `.html` file to add some extra functionality
that you wouldn't get with normal Javascript.
