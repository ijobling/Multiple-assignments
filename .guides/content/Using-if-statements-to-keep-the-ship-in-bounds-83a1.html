# Using if-statements to keep the ship in bounds

Now we can add some *if-statements*{.voc} to our code that keeps the
ship in bounds. We put this in our `updateShip()` function because we
want to perform this check every frame.

1. If the ship's *left* edge is *lower* than `0`, update the ship's
   position so that it's left edge *equals* `0`:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-line-start="24" data-added-lines="27-31" data-header="game.js â†’ updateship() function" data-caption="If the ship's left edge is lower than 0, update the ship's position so that it's left edge equals 0."}
       if (keyIsDown(KEY.LEFT_ARROW)) {
           ship.centerX += 10;
       }

       // don't allow the ship to go out of bounds
       if (ship.left < 0) {
           ship.left = 0;
       }
   }
   ```
2. Save and refresh your preview. Click on game screen, and try to make
   the ship go off the left side of the screen. You should now see that
   the ship won't go off the left side no matter how much you try.
