# Code Challenge - Age Predictor

The program on the left is broken! It's your job to fix it. 
This challenge includes concepts covered in lessons 1 - 3.

## Requirements:
Try your best to fix the program! If working correctly, it _should_ do
the following:

- Ask for the user's name
- Greet them by name
- Ask for the user's age
- Tell the user how old they'll be in 50 years

Click "Open Preview" below to begin:

Did you notice the lines of code that start with `//` ? Those are called
*comment*{.voc} lines. Anything after the `//` is ignored by Javascript.
This is handy when you want to put comments in your code.
