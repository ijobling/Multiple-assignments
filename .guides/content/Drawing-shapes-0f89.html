# Drawing shapes

Let's start with drawing a square. A square is just a rectangle with
equal sides. We can draw any rectangle using the `rect()` function from
the p5 library.

The function takes four *parameters*{.voc}:

![rect parameters](.guides/images/rect.png)

* The `x` coordinate for the **top** edge of the rectangle)
* The `y` coordinate for the **left** edge of the rectangle)
* The **width** of the rectangle
* The **height** of the rectangle

## Try it out!
On the left side of your screen is a preview of `drawing.html`, with the 
*javascript console*{.voc} underneath. We'll start out by using just the 
console to practice drawing some shapes.

1. In the javascript console, call the `rect()` function to draw a 
   rectangle with the same width and height (also known as a square!):
   ```javascript {.console}
   > rect(30, 20, 55, 55);
   ```

   If you get an error message here saying "rect is undefined", make
   sure your `drawing.html` file is saved.

2. Try calling the function again with a different position and size:
   ::: div .flex
   ```javascript {.console}
   > rect(50, 50, 100, 100);
   ```

   Notice how the last thing you draw is always drawn **on top** of
   everything else.

3. Here's how you can draw an ellipse (or a circle), which the same
   parameters as `rect()`, except that the x and y coordinates are at
   the **center** of the circle.

   Try making different ellipses of different sizes:
   ::: div .flex
   ```javascript {.console}
   > ellipse(100, 200, 60, 30);
   > ellipse(130, 200, 30, 30);
   ```

4. You can also draw triangles by specifying 3 points: 
   `triangle(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3)`
   ::: div .flex
   ```javascript {.console}
   > triangle(30, 75, 58, 20, 86, 75);
   ```

**Remember:** you can only call p5 functions in your javascript
console if you are previewing an HTML page that was set up for p5.js.
