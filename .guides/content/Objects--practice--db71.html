# Objects

## Try it out!

Copy-and-paste the following code into your javascript console, and
press [[Enter]].

```javascript {.console .allow-copy}
let student = {
  firstName: "Elizabeth",
  lastName: "Brown",
  grade: 6,
  age: 12,
  email: "liz@example.com"
};
```

The above code assigns an object to a variable named `student`.

Now that you've now defined an object, you can access the
*properties*{.voc} of the object using *dot notation*{.voc}. You can use
these properties just as you would any other variable.

Use dot notation to access the `student` object's properties in your
javascript console:

```javascript {.console}
> student;
< Object { age: 12, grade: 6, email: "liz@example.com", ... }
> student.firstName;
< Elizabeth
> console.log(`${student.firstName} ${student.lastName}`);
  Elizabeth Brown
> student.firstName = "Liz";
> console.log(`${student.firstName} ${student.lastName}`);
< "Liz Brown";
> student.grade;
< 6
> student.grade += 1;
> student.grade;
< 7
```
