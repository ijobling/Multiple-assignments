# Bug #2: shooting a asteroid that's already exploding

If you shoot a asteroid that's already exploding, it will explode again.
This could allow the player to get more points than they should.

To fix this, we can simply check our `.isExploding` property when the
laser hits the asteroid. We'll only run the asteroid-exploding code if
the asteroid is not already exploding.

1. Wrap the lines inside the `handleLaserAsteroidCollision()` function in
   an *if-statement*{.voc} that checks if the asteroid sprite is
   NOT exploding:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-line-start="80" data-added-lines="81-82,87"}
   function handleLaserAsteroidCollision(laser, asteroid) {
    // Don't collide if the asteroid is exploding
    if (asteroid.isExploding === false) {
        laser.remove();
        asteroid.changeAnimation("explosion");
        asteroid.isExploding = true;
        asteroid.animation.onComplete = asteroidFinishedExploding;
    }
    ```
    ***Don't forget** to indent the lines inside the if-statement!*
2. Save your code and refresh your preview. Test by shooting an asteroid
   multiple times, making sure it explodes only once.
