# Strings vs. Numbers

Use your *javascript console*{.voc} to try the following examples.

When you add two numbers together you will get the sum of those numbers.
```javascript {.console}
> let a = 2;
> let b = 4;
> a + b;
< 6
```

When you add two strings together, they will be "glued" together to give
you a new string:
```javascript {.console}
> let word1 = "hot";
> let word2 = "dog";
> word1 + word2;
< "hotdog"
```

Next, see what happens when you add a string and a number:
```javascript {.console}
> let myString = "The number is: ";
> let myNumber = 4;
> myString + myNumber;
< "The number is 4"
```

When you add a string and a number, it will always treat the number as
if it were a string. The result is two strings are glued together.

Now let's try adding two strings that are numbers (be sure to put quotes
around these numbers):
```javascript {.console}
> let num1 = "4";
> let num2 = "2";
> num1 + num2;
< "42";
```
Because we're adding two strings together, the result is two strings
glued together.
