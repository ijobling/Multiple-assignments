# Performance tuning

If our sprite count gets too high, it could really slow down our
computer! To fix this, we need to check each asteroid's position, and if
the asteroid is no longer on the screen, we can remove it from the game.

1. In your `updateAsteroids()` function, use a *for-of loop*{.voc} to go
   through each asteroid and check to see if it has gone off-screen. If
   it has, call `asteroid.remove()` to remove the sprite:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-line-start="54" data-added-lines="59-65" data-header="game.js â†’ updateAsteroids()"}
   function updateAsteroids() {
       // Create an asteroid every 60th frame
       if (frameCount % 60 === 0) {
           createAsteroid();
       }

       // Remove asteroids that go off-screen
       for (let asteroid of asteroids) {
           if (asteroid.top > screenHeight) {
               asteroid.remove();
           }
       }
   }
   ```
2. Save your code and refresh your preview. You should now see the
   sprite count doesn't go very high (it likely won't go above 10):

::: infobox .warning
Whenever your game creates sprites automatically, be sure to add code
that checks to see if the sprites are no longer needed, and removes them
if necessary. Otherwise you may slow down the player's computer!
