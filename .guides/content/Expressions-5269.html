# Expressions

- What do you notice about this calculator? 
- What do the buttons in each outlined group have in common? 
- What names are given to each group? 

An *expression*{.voc .expression} is any unit of code that can be
*evaluated*{.voc .evaluate}, resulting in a *value*{.voc .value}. 

On a calculator, we type an expression by combining *values*{.voc .value}
and *operators*{.voc .operator}.

The [[=]] button tells the calculator to *evaluate*{.voc .evaluate} the
expression and "give" you the resulting *value*{.voc .value}.

You might need to come back to this example every now and then as a
