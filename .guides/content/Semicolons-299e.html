# Semicolons

## Semicolon at the end of the line
In Javascript we put a semicolon at the end of each line. If you type
a line without the semicolon, it still works, but, it's best
practice leave them in. Without it, your code may become difficult to
debug.

Can you spot the missing semicolon below?
```javascript
let name = 'Brenna';
alert('Hello, ' + name)
console.log(name);
```

## When to _not_ use semicolons
We _don't_ put semicolons after code blocks. A code block is a statement
followed by code surrounded in curly braces `{` and `}`, like this:
```javascript
if (temperature < 50) {
    alert("It's cold outside!");
}
```
Notice how we only put a semicolon after the statements _inside_ the
code block.
