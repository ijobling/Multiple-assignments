# Bug #4: The ship can still shoot if it's exploding

The final bug is that the ship can still shoot lasers even while it's
exploding.

![](.guides/images/bug-4.gif)

We can use the `.isExploding` custom property that we created in the
last step to fix this bug.

1. In the `updateLasers()` function, we already have an
   *if-statement*{.voc} around the `createLaser()` call. Instead of
   creating a new if-statement, change the condition to say "if the key
   went down AND the ship is not exploding":
   ```javascript {.numbered data-line-start="126" data-added-lines="129" data-removed-lines="128" data-header="game.js â†’ updateLasers()"}
   function updateLasers() {
       // fire a laser if the space key went down
       if (keyWentDown(KEY.SPACE)) {
       if (keyWentDown(KEY.SPACE) && ship.isExploding === false) {
           createLaser();
       }
   ```

   Remember that we use `&&` to represent "AND" in a condition. See the
   chapter on Logical Operators for more info.

2. Save your code and refresh your preview. Test to make sure you can't
   fire your lasers while the ship is exploding.
