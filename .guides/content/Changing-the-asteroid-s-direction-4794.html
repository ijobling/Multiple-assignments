# Changing the asteroid's direction

The asteroid is moving to the right, because its default direction is 0
degrees.

When direction is set to `0` degrees, it will move to the right. `90`
degrees is down, `180` is left, and `270` is up. You can set direction
to any number between `0` and `360`:

![sprite direction](.guides/images/direction.png){.s9 .m7}

To set a sprite's direction, use the `.setDirection()` function.

1. Add the following line to your `createAsteroid()` function:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-line-start="21" data-added-lines="26"}
   function createAsteroid() {
       let asteroid = createSprite(assets.bigAsteroid);
       asteroid.top = 0;
       asteroid.centerX = screenWidth / 2;
       asteroid.setSpeed(5);
       asteroid.setDirection(90);
   }
   ```
2. Save your code and refresh your preview. Use the *javascript
   console*{.voc} to create another asteroid:
   ```javascript  {.console}
   > createAsteroid();
   ```
   You should now see your asteroid moving downward.
