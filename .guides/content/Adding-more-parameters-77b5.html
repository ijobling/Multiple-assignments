## Challenge: add another parameter for bread type

Some people like white bread, others like wheat. Update your function to include a 2nd parameter for `breadType`:

1. Change the function calls at the bottom of the script to the
   following:
   ```javascript {.numbered data-line-start="9"}
   makeSandwich("grape", "wheat");
   makeSandwich("strawberry", "white");
   ```
2. Add a second parameter to your function called `breadType`. Use
   commas to separate parameters.
3. Update the recipe steps in your function to reflect the bread type.
   For example, it should display "Get 2 slices of wheat bread" if we
   call the function with "wheat" as the `breadType`.
4. Test your code. It should print all steps, and should have "grape"
   and "wheat" mentioned in the first set of steps, and "strawberry" and
   "white" in the second set of steps.
