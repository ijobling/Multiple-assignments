# Anatomy of a p5 script

It's important to understand the purpose of the different functions in
your script, and how they are used by the p5 library.

1. As soon as the script loads, p5 calls the `preload()` function. All
   assets loaded in this function will begin downloading.  

2. When all assets have finished loading, the `setup()` function is
   called. This is where you'll create your canvas, and perform anything
   that needs to be done before drawing.  

3. The `draw()` function is then called repeatedly every 60 seconds.

4. Here we define our "global variables". These are variables that can
   be accessed from any function. {data-select-lines="1-6"}
5. For example, we declare `robotImage` here using "let"... {data-select-lines="6"}
6. ...and we assign robot image here in the preload function. {data-select-lines="9"}
7. We later access the robot image in the draw() function {data-select-lines="20"}
8. Notice how we didn't use "let" here. The "let" keyword declares the
   variable. If we declare a variable inside a function, it can ONLY be
   used inside that function. {data-select-lines="9"}
9. But since we're also using the variable in the `draw()` function... {data-select-lines="20"}
10. we must declare it here as a "global variable". {data-select-lines="6"}
